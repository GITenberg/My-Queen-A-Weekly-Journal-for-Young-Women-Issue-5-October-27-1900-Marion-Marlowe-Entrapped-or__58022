<small>“ILA DE PARLOA.”</small></h3>

<p>Howard Everett, musical critic for the
New York <i>Star</i>, was just entering the office
of his friend, Manager Graham, when he
stopped and almost stared at the young lady
who was emerging. She was by far the most
beautiful girl that Everett had ever seen, and
that was saying much, for the critic had
traveled extensively. She was not over seventeen,
a trifle above medium height, with a
brilliant complexion, luxuriant chestnut hair
and large gray eyes, that flashed like diamonds
as she glanced at him carelessly.</p>

<p>Everett gave a long, low whistle to relieve
his feelings, then threw open the door and
rushed into the office.</p>

<p>“Who the mischief is she?” he blurted out,
instantly.</p>

<p>Clayton Graham, manager of the Temple
Opera Company, turned around from his
desk and smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“So she’s bewitched you, too, has she?” he
asked, jovially. “Well, she’s the first woman
I ever saw that could rattle the cold-blooded,
cynical Howard Everett!”</p>

<p>“But, good Heavens, man, she’s a wonder!
I never saw such a face. It is a combination
of strength, poetry, beauty; and, most wonderful
of all, goodness! Why, that girl is
not only worldly, but she is heavenly, too!
Quick, hurry, old man, and tell me what you
know about her.”</p>

<p>“That won’t take me long,” said Graham,
as he passed his friend a cigar. “Sit down,
Everett, and have a smoke. Perhaps it will
calm your nerves a little.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! I’m not as much rattled as I
look,” said the critic, laughing, “but for once
in my life I am devoured by curiosity, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>novelists say—I want to know where you
discovered that American Beauty.”</p>

<p>“Well, you want to know too much,” was
Graham’s answer; “but, seeing it is you, I
suppose I’ll have to forgive you. But here’s
her story, as much as I know of it—and that,
as I said, is mighty little. She came here
from the country about six months ago. Was
poor as poverty, and had not a friend in the
city. Well, one night Vandergrift—you
know him, the manager of the Fern Garden—heard
her singing on the street in behalf
of one of those preacher fellows. Her
voice was wonderful, and, of course, he
stopped to listen. It was just before his opening
and he needed a singer, inasmuch as my
present prima donna, ‘Carlotta,’ was engaged
to sing at the opening of the Olio, the rival
garden just across the street from his place.
Well, to make a long story short, he made
terms with this girl at once—offered her a
big price for one night, thinking that the
offer would dazzle her so that she would feel
too grateful and all that sort of thing to listen
to any future offers. Well, he billed her
that night as ‘Ila de Parloa,’ and her song
was great; she was the hit of the evening.
The very next morning, what do you think
she did? Took her money and bolted, and
Vandergrift lost track of her entirely.”</p>

<p>“What, didn’t she go over to the Olio or
to some other concert hall?”</p>

<p>“Nit! She just disappeared, leaving no
address behind, after politely informing Vandergrift
that his place wasn’t respectable.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t she know that before she sang
there?” asked the critic, in amazement.</p>

<p>“It seems not,” was the answer. “She
was as green as grass. She thought she was
to sing in some Sunday-school concert or
something of that sort, I fancy.”</p>

<p>Clayton Graham chuckled over what he
thought was a good joke, but his face looked
somewhat serious, in spite of his laughter.</p>

<p>“I made her sit in front and see my show
before I talked to her,” he added, shrewdly,
“and the little Puritan told me, gravely, that
she quite approved of it, and was willing to
sing for me a week on trial.”</p>

<p>“But where in the world has she been hiding
since that night at the Fern Garden?
If her voice is so wonderful, I should certainly
know if she had been singing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she tells me that at just that time she
decided to be a nurse—went up to Charity
Hospital, on Blackwell’s Island, for a time,
but the sights up there upset her so she had
to give it up and look for something different.”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens! The idea of that face being
hidden in a hospital ward!” cried Everett
in horror. “Why, if her voice is half
as beautiful as her face, I’ll give her a column
and make Carlotta green with envy.”</p>

<p>“She’s that already,” said Graham, laughing.
“You just ought to see her! Why, that
woman would kill her, I believe, if she
dared.”</p>

<p>“Strange how jealous these professionals
are,” said Everett, soberly, “and particularly
after they get a bit old and their voices are
not quite up to the standard.”</p>

<p>“Well, Carlotta is unusually jealous,” said
Graham, with a little chuckle. “I suppose it
is because she is suspicious of me. Thinks I
may get stuck on the new face, you understand,
old fellow.”</p>

<p>“Carlotta should know the world by this
time, if any woman ever knew it,” said Everett,
scowling. “Does she imagine you are
going to dance attendance upon her forever?”</p>

<p>“If she does, she’ll be mistaken,” said Graham,
decidedly, “and as for my new singer,
Ila de Parloa, she had better not meddle
with her. The girl is as pure and unsophisticated
as she is beautiful, and, bad as I am,
I admire virtue in a woman.”</p>

<p>“The most of us can,” said Everett, slowly;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>“but, by the way, what is the beautiful
Ila’s right name? ’Pon honor, Clayte, I’ll
never tell it.”</p>

<p>“Her name is Marion Marlowe,” was the
manager’s answer, “but, of course, for business
purposes, we shall stick to ‘Ila.’”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="II. A JEALOUS WOMAN">CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>A JEALOUS WOMAN.</small></h3>

<p>The audience had dispersed and the auditorium
of the great Broadway Theatre was
enveloped in darkness, but Carlotta, the
prima donna of the company, was still pacing
back and forth in her disordered dressing-room.</p>

<p>She was a handsome woman, of the ripe,
sensual type. Her eyes were wide and far
apart, like a panther’s; her nose aquiline, and
her lips red and voluptuous. As she walked
excitedly back and forth she threw her gaudy
garments aside, leaving only a trailing skirt
of rich white silk and a bodice of lace falling
low on her shoulders.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by it, anyway? Am
I to be eclipsed entirely? Is Carlotta to be
put in the background and sneered at by the
people, while that little country girl is standing
in the calcium?”</p>

<p>She turned as she spoke and faced a heavily-built
man, who sat on a trunk in one corner,
gazing calmly at her frenzy.</p>

<p>“Answer me, Clayte Graham!” she almost
screamed. “What do you mean by showing
so much preference to that country snip?”</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders before he
answered. He was growing weary of his
prima donna’s anger.</p>

<p>“I believe I am the manager of this company,
Miss Thompson,” he said, calmly,
“and so long as I hold that position I shall
try to fill it, and one part of my duty is to
select my singers.”</p>

<p>“And why have you selected her, I should
like to know?” cried the woman. “She is as
green as grass and her voice has never had
an hour of training.”</p>

<p>“City people like grass,” was his tantalizing
answer, “and as for training—her voice
don’t need it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course you’ll stick up for her! I
expected it!” was the furious answer. “But
I’ll not put up with it! Do you hear me,
Clayte Graham?”</p>

<p>Again the man shrugged his shoulders and
smiled at her calmly.</p>

<p>“What will you do about it, Miss Temper?”
he asked, very coolly. “You certainly
will not be so foolish as to break your contract?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what you mean,” cried the
woman, more wildly. “I can’t sign another
for two years without your permission. No
manager would dare engage me. Oh, yes, I
understand you.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll understand me better before
I am done with you,” said the manager, emphatically,
“for I’ll make Marion Marlowe a
famous singer yet—so famous that people
will forget that they ever listened to a croaker
like Carlotta.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” shrieked the woman, who had
now grown livid. “That’s right, Clayte Graham.
Heap your sneers and slurs upon me!
I have made money for you for years in more
ways than one—but now that my voice is
failing you throw me over.”</p>

<p>“You have brought it on yourself, Carlotta,
with your fiendish jealousy,” said the man,
more gently.</p>

<p>In an instant the woman was on her knees
before him, the tears streaming over her
painted face and her voice quivering with
emotion.</p>

<p>“Oh, Clayte, Clayte, don’t you know it is
because I love you! Don’t you know that
there is nobody else in this world for me but
you, and yet you reproach and abuse me for
being jealous!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>“Pshaw!” said the man, indifferently, as he
moved away from her. “You are in love
with yourself far more than with me, Carlotta.
You’d scratch the eyes out of my head
this minute if you dared to.”</p>

<p>The woman sprang to her feet and confronted
him like a tigress.</p>

<p>“And you refuse to listen to my entreaties?”
she asked, breathlessly. “Am I to understand
that in future you will do nothing to
please me?”</p>

<p>“I shall do nothing that interferes with my
success in business,” said the man, very
sternly. “I would be a fool indeed to let
myself be influenced by a woman.”</p>

<p>The singer’s breath was coming in gasps
now, and she clenched her hands together until
they were bloodless and rigid.</p>

<p>“Why do you like this girl so much,
Clayte?” she asked, tensely. “Is she so much
handsomer than I, or does she sing so much
better?”</p>

<p>“The public think she is handsomer,” said
the man, evasively, “and you have read what
the critics say about her voice.”</p>

<p>“But you, Clayte, what do you think?” was
the woman’s eager answer; “what is there
about her that makes you prefer her?”</p>

<p>Clayton Graham turned and looked the
woman squarely in the eye.</p>

<p>“Her greatest charm is her modesty,” he
said, slowly and clearly, “and she is attractive
to me because she is a virtuous woman.”</p>

<p>If he had struck her with a lash the words
could not have cut more deeply. The woman
shrank away from him, her breath coming
shorter and faster.</p>

<p>“That is like you, Clayte—to ruin a woman
and then insult her!” she hissed between her
teeth. “But beware, Clayton Graham. You
had better not go too far! Carlotta has blood
in her veins, real blood, that will avenge an
insult. You may yet live to feel the power of
a wronged and scorned woman.”</p>

<p>For answer the manager promptly turned
his back upon her. The next moment she was
alone amid the mocking emblems of mirth.
The last vestige of self-control vanished as
she fell upon the floor in a perfect frenzy of
passion.</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait!” she muttered over and over,
between her set teeth. “Just wait until Carlotta
has gained her self-control, then look
out, Clayte Graham and Marion Marlowe,
for, innocent though you are, I shall not
spare you! I shall have my revenge! Aye,
and it shall be a grand one! Leave a scorned
woman alone for plotting vengeance! I shall
play my cards most cleverly, but each play
shall tell. They shall find me no weakling in
the game of love and jealousy!”</p>

<p>She staggered to her feet and began dressing
rapidly. It was time that she was out of
the dark, empty building. Suddenly a light
tap sounded on the dressing-room door.</p>

<p>The woman opened it and confronted a
beautiful young girl. It was “Signorita Ila
de Parloa,” according to the programme, but
in private life, no other than Marion Marlowe.</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="III. CAUGHT IN A TRAP">CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>CAUGHT IN A TRAP.</small></h3>

<p>“Pardon me, mademoiselle, but are you
ill?” asked the beautiful girl, kindly. “I
thought I heard you weeping, and I could
not resist speaking to you.”</p>

<p>She looked so sweet and innocent, standing
there in the dismal place, that for a moment
a flush of shame dyed the black-hearted
woman’s features; then a thought of Clayton
Graham and the wrong he had done her
flashed over her brain, and instantly the flame
of jealousy leaped again within her.</p>

<p>“I must fool her,” she thought in that one
brief moment. “I must play my cards well,
if I am to wreak my vengeance on this girl.”</p>

<p>Almost like magic, a charming smile took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>the place of her frown, for Carlotta was an
actress as well as a singer.</p>

<p>“I am ill, but only from grief,” she murmured,
brokenly. “A dear friend has died,
and I have only just now heard of it.”</p>

<p>She turned her face a little and put her
handkerchief before it. She wanted to be sure
that she had perfectly controlled her features.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry,” said Marion, sympathetically,
as she took a step forward and
held out both of her white hands.</p>

<p>“It is dreadful to lose a friend. I am truly
sorry for you, Carlotta.”</p>

<p>By this time the wicked woman had formed
her plans, and, as she turned and accepted
the young girl’s hand, she said to her, pleadingly:</p>

<p>“Dear Miss Marlowe, you are so good and
sweet to me that I am almost tempted to ask
you a favor.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the girl, with impulsive
eagerness. “Oh, I shall be so delighted
if I can comfort you.”</p>

<p>“Come home with me to-night, dear,”
begged the woman, brokenly. “I shall grieve
myself to death if I have to stay alone to-night.
Do come; there is nothing to hinder
you, is there?”</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe looked astonished at this
request from a stranger, but she was not accustomed
to stand upon ceremony when the
opportunity was offered her to do a kindness.</p>

<p>“Only my twin sister,” was her thoughtful
answer. “Dollie will expect me, of course,
and will be waiting up. You see she is married,
and I am living with her at present. I
would feel dreadfully to give her a night of
anxiety.”</p>

<p>She spoke so honestly that once more the
woman felt a twinge of shame, but she
steeled herself promptly against all feelings
of sympathy.</p>

<p>“You can send her a message,” she said.
“I’ll write it and tell her how kind you are
to me. So, now, that is settled, and you are
coming. I’ll be ready in a minute and my
carriage is waiting.”</p>

<p>Marion helped her to adjust her wraps and
then followed her to the carriage, the old
door-keeper at the stage door staring after
them curiously.</p>

<p>“That is queer,” he muttered, with a shake
of his head. “There is mischief in the wind;
I’m as sure of it as I’m living.”</p>

<p>But poor, innocent Marion did not dream
of mischief; she was only happy to think that
she was befriending this woman. Almost the
first night of her appearance with the company
she had felt that Carlotta disliked her,
and her gentle heart had been pained by the
thought. She could see no reason why Carlotta
should be jealous of her.</p>

<p>“She is far more experienced and clever
than I,” she said to herself, for she was too
thoroughly modest to ever overrate her own
talents.</p>

<p>Now the woman was smiling at her and
chatting pleasantly, and the noble girl’s heart
was rejoicing in the belief that she had been
mistaken in the prima donna’s sentiments and
that Carlotta was really a friend to her.</p>

<p>“Is your sister as pretty as you are?”
asked Carlotta, after they were seated in the
carriage. She was gazing steadily at Marion
with an expression of admiration.</p>

<p>“Of course you know you are pretty,” she
added, quickly. “All pretty women do, so
you need not look so horrified.”</p>

<p>“I think Dollie is much prettier than I,”
was the low, soft answer. “She has golden
hair and eyes like the violets; then her form
is so plump, and so pretty and graceful.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t there something about the two of
you in the papers not long ago?” was the
singer’s next question. “Wasn’t she abducted
or something, and didn’t you rescue her?”</p>

<p>“A man who boarded with us in the country
abducted her, yes,” said Marion, slowly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>“and I followed and saved her; he was Professor
Dabroski, the Hypnotist.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! What an experience!” said the
woman, feigning great sympathy. “Did he—did
he wrong her, Ila? But you need not
answer; I see it pains you.”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said the girl, very sadly,
“and poor Dollie will never know, because she
has no recollection of her experiences.”</p>

<p>“Well, a man would not meet with much
success in your direction,” said the woman,
laughing loudly. “I fancy you’d hold your
own and make things lively for the one who
tried it.”</p>

<p>“I should certainly resent such an attempt,”
said the brave girl, sternly, “but I
guess I am not so weak as a great many
women.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you are a little paragon of virtue,”
thought the woman, bitterly. “You are a
wonderful creature, and men love you because
you are virtuous.”</p>

<p>Aloud she responded, suavely: “Well, I’m
glad you are strong, my dear. You will need
all your strength to resist the men in our profession.”</p>

<p>The carriage stopped before a telegraph office
as the woman spoke, and Carlotta leaned
over and called to the coachman:</p>

<p>“Bring me a blank and a pencil!” Then
she turned to Marion and said, smilingly:
“You must let me send the message to your
sister, dear.”</p>

<p>Marion told her Dollie’s address, without a
moment’s suspicion, but she could not help
wondering why it took Carlotta so long to
write the message.</p>

<p>“I’ll just write a line of condolence to my
friend whose sister is dead while I’m about
it,” said the woman, as she scribbled another
message and handed the two, with the pad
and pencil, to the driver.</p>

<p>“I just told Dollie that you are staying
with me to-night,” she said, calmly, “but to
expect you about noon to-morrow; is that
right? I can’t possibly think of letting you
leave me before eleven.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Marion, smiling. “I hope
she won’t be worried. It’s the first time that
I have been away from her since I came from
the hospital.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll be separated more in future,”
thought the woman again, and, as the outlines
of a fiendish plan developed slowly before
her vision, her mouth curved in a sneer,
which was promptly changed into a smile for
Marion’s benefit.</p>

<p>“Here we are at home!” she cried, as the
carriage stopped again. “My flat is not beautiful,
but it is very cozy, and you shall have
a room to yourself, so you will be perfectly
comfortable.”</p>

<p>“But I shall not feel that I am much company
for you if I do not remain in the room
with you,” said Marion, smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll feel all right just to know that
you are with me. If I can’t sleep I’ll wake
you up and make you talk to me.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Marion, “I’ll agree to
that; but, dear me, what a pretty home!” she
cried, as she stood gazing into the apartment.</p>

<p>“Here’s a negligé for you,” said Carlotta,
gayly, as she took a flimsy wrapper from the
wardrobe and tossed it to Marion.</p>

<p>“It’s a trifle too negligé,” said Marion,
laughing, as she tried to pull the dainty lace
up over her white throat and shoulders.</p>

<p>The woman was busy making herself comfortable
also, and as she moved about she
talked so gayly and laughed so often that
Marion began to wonder if she had forgotten
her friend’s death completely.</p>

<p>“She must be a queer woman,” she thought
to herself. “She doesn’t need me at all. I
wonder why she asked me to come.”</p>

<p>The more she thought it over the more it
perplexed her.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll have a bite of supper and go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>bed,” said Carlotta, with another laugh.
“You’ll have a glass of wine, won’t you, dear,
and a cigarette, to help digest your welsh
rarebit?”</p>

<p>Her guest’s great eyes darkened as she
stared at her for the space of a second.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thanks,” she said, finally. “I
neither drink nor smoke. You know, I am a
country girl,” she added, laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you won’t, you won’t,” was
the woman’s answer, and just at that moment
the outer door opened unceremoniously.</p>

<p>Marion looked up in astonishment. There
were two well-dressed men, both glittering
with diamonds, standing in the doorway, gazing
at her admiringly.</p>

<small>MARION DEFENDS HERSELF FROM INSULT.</small></h3>
</div>
<p>“Now, Mr. Clayton Graham, I’ll spoil your
white dove for you a trifle, I fancy,” muttered
Carlotta under her breath, as she half
closed her eyes and looked scornfully at Marion.</p>

<p>Aloud she merely said: “Some friends of
mine, Ila. Don’t disturb yourself, dear;
you will find them very agreeable.”</p>

<p>It was fully a minute before Marion could
control her anger sufficiently to rise and confront
her hostess with any degree of calmness,
and even when she did, her cheeks
glowed like carnations, and her wide, gray
eyes had grown black as midnight.</p>

<p>She had come to this woman’s home on an
errand of sympathy, and now, at midnight, as
she was sitting in almost bed-room attire, she
was suddenly forced to receive the company
of two men whom it was plainly to be seen
were both under the influence of liquor.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, this is outrageous!” were
her first indignant words. “How could you
allow them to come in here now. Have you
no shame, no atom of decency about you?”</p>

<p>The base woman almost screamed with
laughter, as the young girl spoke. She was
fairly gloating over her discomfiture, and the
two men joined heartily in her merriment.</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, birdie!” said one of
the men familiarly, as they both stepped inside
and closed the door behind them. “We
won’t hurt such a pretty creature as you are.
No, indeed, we’ve only dropped in to admire
your beauty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and to help eat Carlotta’s welsh
rarebit,” said the other, going straight to the
woman and kissing her. “So glad you invited
us, old girl, make as big a one as you
can, for we are both hungry and thirsty.”</p>

<p>“I’m hungry for a bite of those red lips,”
said the other fellow, lurching over and putting
his hand on Marion’s bare shoulder.</p>

<p>In an instant the young girl sprang back
and put the width of the room between them.</p>

<p>“If you dare to touch me I will kill you,”
she cried sharply, at the same time snatching
a small ivory handled revolver from Carlotta’s
dressing table.</p>

<p>“I believe you would,” said the man, staring
at her admiringly. “By gad! but you are
a beauty! How I would like to tame you!”</p>

<p>“What does ail you, Ila?” said Carlotta,
walking toward Marion and speaking very
coldly. “Put up that thing, dear, and come
and sit down. These gentlemen are my
friends—they will not harm you.”</p>

<p>“If you expected them here you had no
right to invite me,” said the magnificent girl,
hotly. “You have inveigled me here for
some evil purpose, Carlotta!”</p>

<p>She did not move from her position nor
lay down her weapon, and there was a flash
in her eyes that warned the woman to be
careful.</p>

<p>“I invited them here to meet you,” Carlotta
said, very suavely. “They have admired
your beauty and wanted to make your acquaintance,
and I must say you are treating
them in a very extraordinary manner.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>Marion looked at her coldly and held her
head a trifle higher.</p>

<p>“I’m in the habit of choosing whom I shall
meet,” she said, quietly, “and I do not care
to extend my circle of acquaintances to this
class of society.”</p>

<p>“Beware!” cried the now angry woman
with a vicious hiss. “I said they were my
friends. You had better not insult them!”</p>

<p>As the two women stood glaring at each
other the men watched them curiously. Such
an extraordinary spectacle had sobered them
a little.</p>

<p>Marion, young, slight, girlish in her trailing
white robe; the other voluptuous, sensual,
even coarse, in her negligé of flaming
scarlet. It was a spectacle of virtue confronted
by vice—of innocence menaced by
wanton evil.</p>

<p>When Marion spoke again her voice
vibrated strangely and she was fingering the
little revolver nervously.</p>

<p>“I hope and believe your friends are more
honorable than you are, mademoiselle!” she
said, distinctly, “for I doubt if either of them
would dare insult a respectable girl, while
you have deliberately laid a trap for me—for
Heaven alone knows what diabolical motive.”</p>

<p>For just a moment Carlotta looked
ashamed, but she promptly recovered, and
her frame fairly quivered with anger.</p>

<p>“Put that weapon down and dress yourself,”
she said, with a sneer crossing her face.
“Your dress is in the bed-room. I shall be
glad to have you leave me.”</p>

<p>Marion turned toward the bed-room door,
still grasping the pistol.</p>

<p>When she reached the doorway she turned
and faced them, throwing her head back
with a motion of superb defiance.</p>

<p>“If either of you dare to cross this threshold,
look out!” she said briefly, but with unmistakable
decision.</p>

<p>As she was hurrying into her street dress
she heard the three whispering together.
The next second there was a scream from
the woman and a perfect volley of curses.</p>

<p>Clayton Graham had suddenly opened the
door of the apartment and stood glaring at
the trio. With a cry for help Marion
bounded out and ran to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Graham! Save me!” she cried,
half hysterically. “See, I have had to defend
myself from those fiends with this pistol.
Oh, what am I to think of this wicked
woman?”</p>

<p>Clayton Graham looked bewildered for a
moment, then a light dawned on his mind—he
understood Carlotta’s motive. He had
goaded this woman to fury when he spoke to
her of Marion’s virtue; now she was doing
her best to ruin the young girl’s fair name,
and she would have succeeded admirably
with one less noble and courageous than
Marion.</p>

<p>“So this is your revenge,” he muttered,
facing the woman. “You are trying to
blacken her good name, you infamous creature!”</p>

<p>The woman answered nothing, she had
been caught red-handed. No one knew her
better than Clayton Graham—there was no
use trying to deceive him in the matter.</p>

<p>“She was weeping in the dressing-room
and I spoke to her,” went on Marion,
quickly. “She said she was grieving over the
loss of a friend and asked me to come home
with her, so she would not be so lonely.”</p>

<p>“So she was afraid of being lonely—poor
Carlotta,” said the manager with a sneer.
“Well, it’s lucky for you, child, that I saw
you getting into her carriage. I knew she
was up to something, and I called the turn
pretty correctly.”</p>

<p>“So that is why I am honored with your
presence,” said Carlotta, sarcastically. “You
came here to rescue your new sweetheart
Ila from the natural vengeance of your old
sweetheart Carlotta.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>Clayton Graham looked at her scornfully,
but did not deign to reply. Then his glance
swept the full length and breadth of her now
thoroughly sobered companions.</p>

<p>“I knew you were blackguards and loafers
before,” he said, coolly, “but I wouldn’t
have believed that drunk or sober you
wouldn’t respect an innocent girl. Carlotta
must have you in good training, you infamous
puppies!”</p>

<p>He offered his arm to Marion and led her
out of the apartment.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness I was in time,” he said
as they reached the curb, “still, I guess you
would have looked out for yourself all right.
I wouldn’t want you to come for me armed
with even a toy revolver.”</p>

<p>He chuckled good-naturedly as he put
Marion into a cab.</p>

<p>“Don’t fail to be on hand to-morrow
night,” he said, earnestly. “Your song is the
hit of the evening, and the public can’t spare
you. Don’t mind about Carlotta. I’ll watch
her in future. She’s a tigress all right, but I
know her nature.”</p>

<p>Marion thanked him and was soon alighting
at her own door. It was nearly two
o’clock, and the block where she lived was
almost in darkness; as she ran up the steps
she felt a trifle nervous.</p>

<p>While she was searching for her latchkey
she heard a step behind her. She turned
around quickly and confronted a stranger, a
small, swarthy man, his face badly scarred
and hideous.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Marion with
a frightened gasp.</p>

<p>“You,” muttered the fellow instantly, as he
laid a long yellow hand on the fair girl’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>Marion gave a shriek that awoke the
echoes.</p>

<p>In an instant the man turned and fled
down the street; he was out of sight before
any one responded.</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="V. A CHINESE GIRL STEALER">CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>A CHINESE GIRL STEALER.</small></h3>

<p>When Ralph Moore, Marion’s brother-in-law,
opened the door he was astonished to
find her trembling with terror.</p>

<p>“Why, sister, I thought you were not coming
home to-night,” he began, but the girl
stopped him with a quick explanation.</p>

<p>“Carlotta trapped me,” she said, hotly, “but
I escaped from her safely! Now, who do you
suppose that fellow was, the dreadful creature
that just grabbed my arm right here on the
steps. My shriek must have frightened you
awfully, brother.”</p>

<p>Ralph Moore looked up and down the
street, but there was no one in sight, so in
another minute they went up to his apartment.</p>

<p>Dollie Marlowe, or Dollie Moore, as she
was now, had been married only three weeks,
but her little flat already had a homelike look,
and both she and her husband were radiantly
happy.</p>

<p>As Marion had said, Dollie’s face was the
prettier of the two, but it was a babyish prettiness
that meant weakness and uncertainty,
while Marion’s was the glorious beauty of
decision.</p>

<p>As Marion told them of her evening’s experience
Dollie’s rosy cheeks paled, while
Ralph Moore ran his fingers through his
black curls in excitement.</p>

<p>“What a bad, wicked woman,” cried the
little bride, indignantly. “To think of her
subjecting you to such an insult. Why, she
is a disgrace to her sex, isn’t she, darling?”</p>

<p>“She is indeed,” was her husband’s fond
answer as he stopped in his excited pacing
to and fro, to kiss his wife’s soft, dimpled
shoulder.</p>

<p>“It is a shame that our dear sister should
have to come in contact with such a creature,
and to think that Marion was trying to do
her a kindness.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>Marion had removed her hat and unbound
her beautiful hair, and now sat sipping a cup
of chocolate that Dollie had hurriedly made
for her.</p>

<p>“What puzzles me most is that man,” she
said, thoughtfully. “Oh, what a terrible face
he had—it was hideously scarred and disfigured.”</p>

<p>“He was probably drunk,” was her
brother-in-law’s answer. “And no doubt he
mistook you for some one else. I’ll tell the
officer on the beat to keep a look-out for him
in future.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is very evident that there was no
officer on the beat to-night,” said Marion,
laughing, “for I screamed as loudly as I possibly
could, and I only succeeded in awakening
the echoes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the cop was probably in the corner
saloon,” said Ralph Moore, disgustedly;
“still, it’s lucky you screamed and scared the
fellow. No one knows what he might have
done if you hadn’t, sister.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have some news for you,” said
Dollie, suddenly. “I got a letter from our old
friend, Bert Jackson, to-day. He is coming
home to be ready to sail for Europe with his
foster-father next week, and in the fall he is
going to college.”</p>

<p>“That is good news,” said Marion, with a
happy smile. “I wondered why we hadn’t
heard from Bert since your wedding, but I
suppose he has been having such a good time
with his new parents in Canada that he did
not have time to write to his old friends.”</p>

<p>“He is a lucky boy,” said Dollie, thoughtfully.
“Why, just think, only a few months
ago he was a waif in a county poor farm!
Oh, how lucky it was that he ran away. It
is not every poor orphan that has such good
fortune.”</p>

<p>“And I am so glad that I helped him to
escape,” said her sister, laughing. “I gave
him five dollars the night he ran away—it was
all I had, for I was only a country girl then,
and you know, sister, that our father did not
give us much money.”</p>

<p>“Poor old dad,” said Dollie, with the tears
springing to her eyes. “He has been a different
man since you paid off the mortgage
on the farm, Marion. Mother says he is so
gentle that we would hardly know him.”</p>

<p>This illusion to one of Marion’s many
noble deeds made the fair girl very happy. It
had been the greatest pleasure of her life to
be able to pay off that mortgage on the
homestead.</p>

<p>“It is a pity that it took him so long to
learn that ‘gentleness is best,’” she said,
sadly. “Poor old father would have been far
happier if he had learned it earlier. We
would have all been happier in our life in the
country.”</p>

<p>They sat and talked a little while longer,
then retired for a few hours’ rest before daylight.</p>

<p>When Marion awoke in the morning she
found that Ralph had already bought the
morning papers, and, as usual, she glanced
them over before eating her breakfast.</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind the critics are to me,” she
said as she read the notice of her singing in
the <i>Star</i>. “And how dreadfully they speak
of Carlotta, saying that her voice has lost its
freshness, and all that sort of thing, I can
hardly blame the woman for disliking me.”</p>

<p>“Well, she has let her professional jealousy
go too far,” said Ralph, hotly. “When she
tries such tricks as she did last night it is high
time she was halted.”</p>

<p>“I guess Mr. Graham will read her a lecture
to-day,” said Marion, slowly, “It remains
to be seen what effect it has upon her.”</p>

<p>“Here is a dreadful thing,” said Dollie,
who was glancing over a part of the paper.
“A young girl has just been rescued from an
opium den. It seems she was stolen by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Chinamen and kept a prisoner in one of their
houses.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that sort of thing happens every
day,” said her husband, quickly. “There’s a
tremendous traffic in ‘white slaves,’ as they
call them. Those yellow devils have a mania
for white girls in this country.”</p>

<p>“I think it is horrible,” said Marion, shuddering.
“It is almost incredible that such
horrors can exist in a Christian country.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless they do,” said Ralph, a
little absently. He was busy at that moment
reading the rest of the article. Suddenly he
almost sprang from his chair at the breakfast
table, and a look of horror overspread his
countenance.</p>

<p>“Quick, Marion! Describe that fellow that
you saw last night on the steps. Was he
small and black, and was his face all scars,
and was there anything about him that
looked like a Chinaman?”</p>

<p>Marion thought a little before she answered.</p>

<p>“He certainly was small and had a yellowish
skin, and his face was all scars, and his
eyes black and beady. Come to think of it,
he did look like a Chinaman, Ralph, but for
goodness sake do tell us what is the matter!”
she said, earnestly.</p>

<p>“That fellow is wanted by the police,” was
Ralph Moore’s prompt answer. “He is a
sort of an agent for rich Celestials in the city,
he goes around trying to steal young girls,
and they say that in several instances he has
been successful.”</p>

<p>Both Dollie and Marion stared at him in
astonishment for a minute, then Marion’s
gray eyes flashed ominously, and her lips
curved in a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, I pity him if he ever tries to steal
me,” she said, decidedly, “for I have no special
liking for ‘chow-chop-suey.’”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="VI. A GLIMPSE BEHIND THE SCENES">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>A GLIMPSE BEHIND THE SCENES.</small></h3>

<p>At half-past seven that evening Marion
Marlowe was at the theatre. She was a trifle
apprehensive of what was coming. As she
tripped around to the stage door every person
on the street turned to look at her, for
New York was almost mad at the moment
with admiration for “Ila de Parloa.” It was
not altogether the girl’s magnificent voice that
had charmed them, but her beautiful face and
natural, unaffected manner on the stage had
been a great treat after a long siege of conceited
actors and airy prima donnas.</p>

<p>During her engagement so far she had
sang only simple ballads, which were sandwiched
in between the regular scenes in a
manner known only to comic operas and
vaudeville.</p>

<p>But the quaint, modest dress of the charming
singer, and, best of all, her freedom from
conceit, had won the respect of even the critics,
which is a thing not easily done by any
singer.</p>

<p>Marion felt strange in the atmosphere of
the monstrous theatre, yet she was fast becoming
accustomed to its shallow mockeries,
and deep down in her soul there had always
been a desire for fame, which now, for the
first time in her short life, was within some
possibility of gratification.</p>

<p>“If it was not for Carlotta’s jealousy,” she
whispered to herself, as she climbed the narrow
stairs behind the scenes—“but what can
I do if she chooses to injure me?”</p>

<p>“Howdy, signorita!” called a voice as she
reached the top of the stairs. “You are early,
as usual, and yet you don’t ‘make up’ much,
either. If it wasn’t for my everlasting complexion,
I wouldn’t be here, you bet. I’d
have spent another hour in bed wouldn’t
you, Miss Kingsley?”</p>

<p>The speaker was a chorus girl, whose name
Marion did not know. She was standing in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>the doorway of a big dressing-room, which
she shared with a dozen others.</p>

<p>“Do you think so much ‘make-up’ is necessary?”
asked Marion, pleasantly. “Somehow,
I am always afraid of getting my nose too
white and my ears too red. I do wish there
wasn’t such a thing as having to use it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’d all look like ghosts if we didn’t,”
said the girl. “Those footlights make you
ghastly if your face isn’t painted.”</p>

<p>“It makes some people look like frights,
anyway,” called another voice, shrilly. “It
is just too funny to see some folks prink when
they can’t be anything but scrawny and ugly,
no matter how much they paint and whitewash!”</p>

<p>The girl in the doorway glanced over her
shoulder scornfully.</p>

<p>“You wear ‘symmetricals’ yourself, Miss
Impudence,” she said, tauntingly. “I may be
scrawny around the shoulders, but my legs
are all right, and legs are all that is wanted
in the chorus nowadays.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was voices that were desired,”
said Marion, dryly; “but, then, I am new; I
don’t know much about requirements.”</p>

<p>“I notice you are mighty careful not to
wear your dress short at either end,” called
another voice. “What is the matter with
your shape, Signorita Ila?”</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe flushed a little, but did
not reply, so the girl in the doorway promptly
answered for her.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s too modest and shy, don’t you
understand! But just wait a week, girls—then
you may have to look to your laurels.
Can’t make me believe that the little ‘greeny’
isn’t all right! She’s fresh from the country,
and ought to be as plump as a partridge.”</p>

<p>“You are the only girl in the chorus that
ain’t jealous, Jennie,” called a coarse masculine
voice, as Jack Green, the “property man,”
came by at that minute.</p>

<p>Jennie was just stepping into her slippers
when she caught sight of Jack. In an instant
one of them went spinning in his direction.</p>

<p>Jack caught it deftly and held it in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Out on first,” he said, with a grin. “Now,
when you want it back you’ll have to kiss
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind doing that a little bit,”
cried the girl, unhesitatingly, and in a second
she had both arms over the property
man’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“You’re a daisy, Jack, and I’m awfully
mashed on you,” she said, candidly; “but you
haven’t got enough wealth, so, you see, I must
stick to the Johnnies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want you,” was the fellow’s
equally honest answer. “I’m stuck on the
new beauty, the charming Ila. I wonder if
she would give me a kiss if I asked her.”</p>

<p>Marion was standing right in front of him
as he made the remark, and in an instant all
of the chorus girls came out to see how she
took it.</p>

<p>“No use to play the prude,” thought Marion,
with a shudder. “These people see no
harm in kissing, so I must try and get out of
it nicely.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Green,” she said, with a half
smile, “I would not dream of kissing you before
all these young ladies! Why, they would
scratch my eyes out, and I am sure I would
deserve it.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so bad for a ‘greeny,’” said
Jennie. She had got her slipper back now,
and was adjusting it carefully.</p>

<p>“Make less noise up there, girls!” called
out the stage manager from the stairs.</p>

<p>The girls scampered back into their dressing-room,
leaving Marion and the property
man together.</p>

<p>“Won’t you kiss me, sweetie?” said Jack
Green, in an undertone, as he came closer to
her. “I wasn’t joking a little bit, Ila. I’m
just dying to kiss you.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>Marion looked up at the burly fellow and
tried to read his face. She had disliked him
from the first, but had always tried not to
show it.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you mean to insult me, Mr.
Green,” she said, after a second. “You professionals
do not look upon kisses as a very
serious matter, but, you see, I am a country
girl, and I have been taught differently. I
am saving my lips for the man whom I shall
marry.”</p>

<p>Jack Green gave a whistle of genuine surprise,
for he saw by the girl’s face that she
was sincere and honest.</p>

<p>“Well, you are a novelty,” he said, after a
minute. “Been on the stage nearly a week
and don’t believe in kissing.”</p>

<p>“That is one reason why I shall never be
an actress,” said Marion, sadly. “It does
seem awful to me to be kissing and hugging
so indiscriminately.”</p>

<p>“You’d like it if you tried it,” said Green,
with a wicked leer. “Your lips were made to
kiss; they are just like cherries—it’s mighty
mean of you, I think, to be so stingy with
them.”</p>

<p>“I shall kiss the man that I love,” said
Marion, softly, as she attempted to quietly
pass the fellow and go to her dressing-room.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m a chump if I let you go that
way,” said the big brute, suddenly. “You’re
bound to kiss somebody if you stay in this
business, and, by the powers, I’m going to
be the first one!”</p>

<p>His face had reddened with passion as he
spoke, and as Marion glanced at him quickly
she found his eyes almost devouring her.</p>

<p>“Let me pass! It is late!” she commanded,
sternly.</p>

<p>“Not until I have tasted of those red lips,
Ila,” said the fellow. The next second he had
caught her in his arms and was pressing her
roughly to his bosom.</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="VII. MARION MAKES ANOTHER ENEMY">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>MARION MAKES ANOTHER ENEMY</small></h3>

<p>For a second Marion Marlowe was almost
paralyzed with fright, but as she felt the fellow’s
mustache touching her cheek she raised
her right hand and gave him a blow with all
the force of her strong young muscles.</p>

<p>“Take that for your impudence, you cur!”
she whispered, tensely.</p>

<p>Jack Green released her and fell back a
step, and just at that moment Carlotta came
out of her dressing-room.</p>

<p>“Hello!” she said, abruptly, as she caught
sight of Marion. “You here again to-night,
you little simpleton!”</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe was now trembling with
indignation already, but at the woman’s
words she became suddenly calm.</p>

<p>“Certainly I am here, Carlotta!” she said,
quietly, “where else should I be but keeping
my engagements?”</p>

<p>“She means that she is engaged to me,”
spoke up Jack Green, sneeringly. “I was just
sealing our betrothal with a kiss or two,” he
added.</p>

<p>“How dare you!” cried Marion, turning
on him furiously.</p>

<p>Carlotta sneered as she came a little nearer.</p>

<p>“I thought your goodness was all put on,”
she said, coldly. “So you prefer a ‘property
man’ to a gentleman, do you?”</p>

<p>The beautiful young girl turned on her
heel with a disdainful glance. She had had
quite enough of this sort of thing for one
evening.</p>

<p>As she walked deliberately to her dressing-room,
both Carlotta and Green stared after
her, and in spite of their anger they could not
conceal their admiration.</p>

<p>“By gad! But she’s a corker!” was the
property man’s exclamation.</p>

<p>“She thinks because the public likes her
that she owns the show,” muttered Carlotta,
“but I’ll fix her yet, the little country hussy!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>“Well, Graham is dead gone on her all
right,” said the man quickly, eying the
woman sharply as he spoke to see how she
took it.</p>

<p>“Clayte Graham is a knave and a fool,” she
hissed fiercely. “I’ll teach him to play fast
and loose with a woman like Carlotta.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have a pretty taut string
on him by this time,” said the fellow,
shrewdly, “and you ain’t the woman to be
cut out by a snip of a girl like that.”</p>

<p>“I should say not, Green,” said the woman
slowly; then she seemed to think of something,
for she turned and looked at him
earnestly.</p>

<p>Jack Green was too shrewd not to know
what he was doing. He had an end to gain
or he would not have been neglecting his
own duties at that minute. This woman,
Carlotta, had never noticed him before. She
had always held her head very high where
the property man was concerned, and her
constant disdain had nettled him sorely.</p>

<p>Like many another man, he desired what
was beyond him; but now his opportunity
had come to accomplish his ends; he had
only to help her wreak her vengeance on
another.</p>

<p>“Green,” whispered the woman, suddenly,
as she took a step nearer, “Help me
to sully that girl’s character so that Clayte
Graham will believe it and I will reward
you handsomely. Say, will you do it?”</p>

<p>A dull gleam of light flashed from the
property man’s eyes as he half closed his
eyelids and peered at her through them.</p>

<p>Carlotta’s face flushed through her paint
and she drew back quickly. She read his
meaning.</p>

<p>“Think!” urged the man, “your position is
at stake! If Graham falls in love with that
girl he will drop you in a minute, and, mark
my words, it will be a long day, Carlotta,
before you get another rich lover.”</p>

<p>“Well, how can you help me?” asked the
woman, shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Dead easy,” was the prompt answer.
“I’ll fix that all right. I’ll compromise her
myself if I can’t find any one else to do it;
but my reward, Carlotta?”</p>

<p>“You shall have your reward,” said the
woman in a chilling whisper, “when that
girl’s character is ruined.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first “call” was given as Carlotta hurried
back to her room, and Jack Green
turned hastily to attend to business.</p>

<p>A second later there was a slight noise
behind a stack of old scenery and after another
second a girl slipped out from the
mass, and shaking her skirts clear ran softly
to her dressing-room.</p>

<p>“So that is the kind of a fellow you are,
Jack Green,” she murmured to herself, at
the same time wringing her small hands in
perfect agony.</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe was ready to “go on”
when this girl reached the dressing-room.
It was a little box of a place, but they occupied
it together.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Lindsay, what is the matter?”
said Marion, quickly. “You look terribly
pale. Has anything happened? Are you
ill? Is there anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>To all of these questions Miss Lindsay
only shook her head. She was a frail, delicate
girl, whom the others had nicknamed
“The Feather.”</p>

<p>Marion saw at once that the girl did not
wish her sympathy, so she said nothing
more, but went over by the door to wait
where she could hear the call to the wings.</p>

<p>Miss Lindsay hurried into her stage costume
as quickly as possible, but she took
very little pains with it.</p>

<p>“What is the use of trying to look
pretty?” she said finally. “No one cares
how I look, so I’m not going to bother.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>“Oh, I am sure somebody cares,” said
Marion, quickly, “and really, Miss Lindsay,
you should put on more rouge. You are
awfully pale. I am afraid the calcium will
make you look ghastly.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if it does,” said the girl indifferently,
but she did smear a little of the
red stuff across her cheeks and eyelids.</p>

<p>There was another call and the chorus
came rushing from the stairs—in less than
a moment the overture would be ended.</p>

<p>Marion did not have to go on for some little
time, but she followed slowly down the
stairs, in order to stand in the wings, as she
always enjoyed listening to the chorus.</p>

<p>Just as she reached the stairs she observed
one of the chorus girls waiting for her. As
she peered through the dim light she saw
that it was Miss Lindsay.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is going to confide in me,
after all,” Marion thought. “Poor thing,
she is in some trouble—any one can see it.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked, as she reached
the girl and put one hand tenderly on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>There was a curious look in the girl’s eyes
as she answered. She put her face up close
to Marion’s so that no one would hear her.</p>

<p>“If anything should happen to me to-night,
Signorita, I want you to tell Jack that
I was watching behind the pile of old
scenery. I saw him with you and with her,
Carlotta,” she whispered, “so if anything
happens he will understand it.”</p>

<p>“But what can happen?” asked Marion,
sharply.</p>

<p>The girl darted down the stairs without
stopping to answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, she is planning something desperate!”
murmured Marion, “and great
Heaven! she can accomplish it, too, if she
wishes, for every one of the chorus carries a
sword in this act! Oh, I must go this minute
and warn Mr. Graham!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 title="VIII. THE CONQUEST OF A CRITIC">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>THE CONQUEST OF A CRITIC.</small></h3>
</div>

<p>As Marion made her way across the scene-room
she was almost trembling with alarm,
for her keen intuition had told her that she
was right in her surmise and that there must
be no delay if she wished to prevent a tragedy.
She peered here and there, looking for
Mr. Graham, and then it suddenly occurred
to her that he would be in the front of the
house rather than behind the scenes during a
performance, and that she must look for Mr.
Brown, the stage manager, instead.</p>

<p>She had just caught sight of him in the
distance, talking to the “calcium man,” when
the awful thing happened.</p>

<p>It seemed to Marion that she had been
listening for it all the time, yet she stood
perfectly still for a moment, her nerves tense
with agony.</p>

<p>The chorus was going through a sword
drill at the time, and everything was moving
rhythmically, when there came a sharp
scream.</p>

<p>Marion heard an order given, the curtain
was rung down, and then Mr. Brown’s voice
came to her as if from some great distance.
He was talking calmly to the audience, telling
them what had happened. There was a
dim murmur of applause from the front of
the house, then Marion heard no more, for
she had suddenly come to her senses just as
two of the “supers” came “behind,” carrying
one of the chorus girls between them.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried Marion, as she instantly
knelt by the wounded girl’s side. “Give me
a piece of ribbon or a big handkerchief, someone.
She will bleed to death if we don’t prevent
it. Now, a stick of some kind!” she
added, as some one handed her a piece of
ribbon. As deftly as possible Marion wound
the ribbon around the girl’s bleeding arm,
and then, thrusting a stick through it, she
began twisting it gently.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>The stage manager had already sent for a
physician, but before he arrived Marion had
stopped the flow of blood.</p>

<p>“Well done, my brave girl,” said the doctor,
smiling at her. “You have saved this
girl’s life. It is a pity there are not more
women like you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I have had experience as a
nurse,” said Marion, quickly. “I was in Charity
Hospital for awhile this winter.”</p>

<p>“That accounts for it, then,” said the doctor,
as he applied a ligature.</p>

<p>Marion helped him deftly, all the time listening
for her cue. Fortunately there was a
good deal for the other performers to do before
she was needed.</p>

<p>For in less than five minutes the curtain
had gone up again, showing the sword drill
exactly where the momentary tragedy had
left it.</p>

<p>“One of the chorus girls has pricked herself
with her sword,” the audience was told.
No one, except a few of her companions,
dreamed that the injury was serious.</p>

<p>When Marion’s turn came at last, Miss
Lindsay’s arm was all bandaged and she had
just opened her eyes with a return of consciousness.</p>

<p>As Marion rose from her place beside her
on the dusty floor of the scene-room she
caught a glance from Jack Green’s eyes as
he stood a little way from them.</p>

<p>The fair girl shuddered as she saw his
look; it was so full of an ugly, brooding hatred.</p>

<p>“He hates her and she loves him,” was her
whispered comment. The next moment she
was out on the stage, and everything else was
forgotten.</p>

<p>“Ila de Parloa’s” appearance was always
the signal for great applause, but to-night
the audience fairly outdid themselves. It
seemed as though they were determined to
give her an unusual welcome. Once, as she
sang, Marion glanced suddenly into the
wings. Carlotta stood there watching her,
with a face that was almost ashen.</p>

<p>When the song was ended there was tremendous
applause. Marion had never sung
better, and her audience appreciated the
effort.</p>

<p>She was encored until she was obliged to
go back, and this time, just as she stepped
on the stage, she caught sight of Mr. Graham
in the rear of a box, talking to a gentleman.</p>

<p>A curtain call followed, which Marion took
gracefully and modestly. It was the crowning
whisp of fuel to Carlotta’s already flaming
fire of jealousy.</p>

<p>“I tell you, she shall not sing in this company
another week,” she said, with choking
voice, as Clayton Graham passed her.</p>

<p>Graham had gone behind the scenes to congratulate
Marion, as well as to present his
friend, Howard Everett, who had for a week
past been begging for an introduction.</p>

<p>“How are you going to prevent it?” asked
Graham, carelessly, as both he and Everett,
who was a newspaper critic, paused for a
moment.</p>

<p>“I’ll find a way!” was Carlotta’s answer as,
with a disdainful glance at Everett, she
flounced out upon the stage.</p>

<p>“She hates you almost as badly as she does
me,” said Graham, chuckling. “She’d knock
our heads together this minute if she dared.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t always a critic’s lot to be loved,”
said Everett, shrugging his shoulders, “but,
then, I am not ambitious to be loved by a
creature like Carlotta.”</p>

<p>“You prefer a dainty maid like Ila, I suppose,”
said Graham, laughing.</p>

<p>“‘Signorita de Parloa’ is glorious!” was
the critic’s answer, and strangely enough,
his words were honest—he felt them as he
spoke them.</p>

<p>Marion was greatly pleased to make the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>acquaintance of the critic, for he had been the
kindest of them all in his daily reviews. As
she stood chatting with him pleasantly, Miss
Lindsay came up to her. She looked pale
and scared, and her arm was carried painfully.</p>

<p>“I thank you for what you did,” she said,
in a tremulous voice, “but it would have been
better if you hadn’t done it, Ila. I cut myself
on purpose—is it possible that you did
not guess it?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Marion, sternly. “Don’t say
that, Miss Lindsay. I am glad I was able
to help you, dear, but you look sick and weak.
Can I do anything more for you?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said the girl, and then
she blushed furiously and added:</p>

<p>“Jack is going home with me. He is sorry,
he says. Please don’t tell any one what happened
this evening, will you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly will not,” said Marion, kissing
her.</p>

<p>She would have liked to warn the girl
about Green, but another look at the wan,
white face quickly silenced the desire.</p>

<p>“She loves him, and it would kill her if she
knew,” she thought. “Oh, why is it that
some men are so treacherous to those who
love them!”</p>

<p>She turned back to Mr. Everett with a
saddened heart. The sorrow in this young
girl’s face had destroyed Marion’s happiness
for the evening.</p>

<p>“You are very sympathetic, signorita,”
said the critic, as he watched her.</p>

<p>“Too much so for my own good,” was the
fair girl’s answer. “It was because of my intense
sympathy that I was obliged to resign
my position as a nurse. I do hope that it
will not also ruin my career as a singer.”</p>

<p>“Nothing must ruin that,” was Howard
Everett’s quick answer. “You will be great
some day, both great and famous. There is
a wide difference in those words, although
many do not seem to know it. A woman
with a face and voice like yours should have
the world at her feet, and you can, signorita;
you have only to think so.”</p>

<p>He spoke softly and tenderly, yet with a
masterful tone, and Marion felt the thrill of
his words through every fibre of her being.</p>

<p>As she glanced up suddenly, their eyes
met for a moment; then Marion, with an unaccountable
blush, held out her white hand
and bade him “good-evening.”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="IX. THE HIDEOUS CHINAMAN APPEARS AGAIN">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>THE HIDEOUS CHINAMAN APPEARS AGAIN.</small></h3>

<p>When Marion reached her dressing-room
after leaving Howard Everett she found a
note awaiting her.</p>

<p>She was about to throw it aside, thinking
that it was one of the nightly “mash notes”
which she had been receiving all the week,
when a sharper glance revealed that the
handwriting was familiar.</p>

<p>She tore it open hastily and a smile of
pleasure lighted her features as she read.
It was from Alma Allyn, one of her dearest
friends. Miss Allyn told her briefly
that she was in the theatre and would be at
the stage door to go home with her right
after the performance.</p>

<p>Miss Allyn was a newspaper reporter and
a very clever woman. She had known both
the Marlowe girls ever since they came to
the city, and it was in her flat that Dollie
Marlowe was married.</p>

<p>Since Dollie’s marriage she had been living
alone, but she visited the bride as often
as possible.</p>

<p>Marion hurried on her street dress so as
not to keep her waiting, and very soon after
eleven o’clock the girls took a cab and were
driven up town together.</p>

<p>“I have a lot of news for you, Marion,”
was Miss Allyn’s greeting, “and now that
we have a few minutes together we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>make up for lost time and tell each other
everything.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t much to tell,” was Marion’s
quick answer; “only Carlotta hates me and
is trying to make trouble for me, and I
can’t help feeling that she is going to be
successful.”</p>

<p>“She’s a bad woman, from all accounts,”
said Miss Allyn, shortly; “for, besides being
divorced from her husband, she is Clayton
Graham’s mistress—and not a very faithful
one, either, according to rumor.”</p>

<p>“How perfectly awful,” said Marion, gasping,
“and to think that I went home with
her one night in the hope of making a
friend of her.”</p>

<p>Miss Allyn looked at her with an inquiring
glance, and Marion made haste to
tell her all about it.</p>

<p>“You were lucky to get out so easily,”
she said, when the story was finished. “I
wouldn’t trust that woman the length of my
nose. Why I believe she’d knife a person
if she got very angry.”</p>

<p>“Well, now tell me your news,” said Marion,
quickly. “I want to get that unpleasant
taste out of my mind as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“My news will make your heart go pit-a-pat,
Marion,” said Miss Allyn, laughing,
“for I saw your devoted admirer, Dr. Reginald
Brookes, to-day, and he fairly loaded
me down with tender messages for you.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he bring them himself?”
asked Marion, slyly.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t,” said Miss Allyn. “He’s up to
his ears in business. You know he only
came down from the Prison Hospital yesterday,
and to-day he was around looking
up an office.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he’ll be up to-morrow, then?”
said Marion, dreamily. “I shall be glad to
see him, for he will bring all the news from
the Island.”</p>

<p>“It is like getting a message from Hades,
isn’t it, Marion?” asked Miss Allyn, shivering.
“Some way I always had a horror
of Blackwell’s Island!”</p>

<p>“Well, vice is quite concentrated up
there,” said her companion, smiling, “but
there is an advantage in that which we don’t
have here in the city.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s so,” said Miss Allyn, promptly;
“it is badly scattered here. You dodge it
on one corner only to bump into it on another.
Oh, the crooks and the criminals
are not all on the Island by any means!
But don’t you wish to hear any of the doctor’s
messages, Marion? There’s one that
I’m sure will be very pleasant.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Marion, striving hard
not to show her eagerness.</p>

<p>“I have a great notion not to tell you,
Miss Indifference,” said Miss Allyn. “But
here it is: Dr. Brookes is taking music lessons.
He thinks he will study for the operatic
stage, and has an amazing taste all of
a sudden for comic opera.”</p>

<p>Marion burst out laughing as Miss Allyn
finished.</p>

<p>“You are surely joking, Alma,” she exclaimed,
her cheeks glowing. “What do
you mean by telling such stories?”</p>

<p>“It’s the Gospel truth,” said Miss Allyn,
chuckling. “A few months ago he was desperately
interested in the sick people on
Blackwell’s Island: now he is possessed with
an insane desire to go into comic opera.
Why, Marion, I’ll bet a quarter that if you
started a dressmaking establishment, Dr.
Reginald Brookes would learn to do fine
sewing.”</p>

<p>The flush on Marion’s cheek had deepened
steadily and her eyes sparkled with
mischief at Miss Allyn’s suggestion, but she
could hardly believe that the doctor was
quite so badly smitten as her friend’s remarks
would indicate, and she was greatly
surprised at his new ambition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>“Why, he never told me that he sang,”
she said, after a minute; “although, of
course, I knew he was a great admirer
of music.”</p>

<p>“He is passionately fond of singing,”
said Miss Allyn, smiling, “and unless I’m
much mistaken, he is also passionately fond
of a certain singer.”</p>

<p>She pinched Marion’s arm very gently as
she spoke, but the beautiful girl had no answer
ready.</p>

<p>“Here we are at Dollie’s,” said Miss Allyn,
poking her head out of the carriage
window; “now you must run in and let them
know you are safe, and then you must come
over and stay all night at my bachelor’s
quarters.”</p>

<p>Her friend sprang out of the carriage and
ran up the steps. In a few minutes she returned,
bringing a small handbag with her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion, I’ve seen a sight!” was Miss
Allyn’s greeting. “A creepy-looking ‘chink’
just passed the carriage. His face was all
scars, and he was simply hideous.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was a Chinaman?” asked
Marion, quickly; “a small, swarthy fellow,
with long, yellow, clawlike fingers?”</p>

<p>“He was small and swarthy all right,” was
the answer, “but his hands were out of sight.
I couldn’t see his fingers.”</p>

<p>“That is very strange,” said Marion, half
to herself, as she seated herself beside Miss
Allyn. “That is the second time I’ve known
of that fellow being around here, and I’d
like to know what he is striving to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“He looked like a ghoul,” was Miss Allyn’s
extraordinary answer. “I have seen
pictures of such creatures; they are always
haunting graveyards.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he can be that wicked Chinaman
who steals young girls,” said her companion,
thoughtfully, and then she told of
the article Dollie’s husband had seen in the
paper.</p>

<p>Miss Allyn had been in the newspaper
business too long not to know that even
stranger things than this occurred in a big
city, so she listened without a word and at
the end she seemed to be thinking deeply.</p>

<p>“We must be on the lookout in the future,”
she said, “and above all we must warn
Dollie to be very particular. She must
never step out after dark unless Ralph is
with her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think she does” was Marion’s answer;
then a sudden idea seemed to come to
both of them.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is looking for you,” Miss Allyn
said, slowly.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope not,” said Marion, with a
shiver, “but I’d much rather it would be
me than my darling sister.”</p>

<small>CLAYTON GRAHAM’S MURDER</small></h3>

<p>When Marion awoke the next morning
she saw Alma Allyn standing by her bed-side,
her eyes fairly bulging with horror.</p>

<p>“Quick, Marion, look!” she cried, holding
out the morning paper. “Clayton Graham
is dead. He has been murdered in his
own apartments.”</p>

<p>The young girl sat bolt upright in bed and
snatched the paper hastily. She could
hardly speak for a moment after she
finished reading.</p>

<p>“It was Carlotta, no doubt,” said Miss
Allyn, slowly, “for they say she is missing
and has been since midnight.”</p>

<p>“It is dreadful,” cried Marion, springing
out of bed. “Oh, it doesn’t seem possible
that she could have done it.”</p>

<p>“Well, they know it was a woman,” said
her friend, as she glanced over the paper
again, “and who so likely as Carlotta?”</p>

<p>“I knew they had been quarreling frequently
of late—every one in the company
knew it,” was the thoughtful answer, “but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>still I can’t think that she would actually
murder him, for, in spite of her bad temper,
I believe she loved him.”</p>

<p>“It was probably done in a second; she
had, no doubt, lost her self-control completely
when she shot him,” said Miss
Allyn.</p>

<p>Marion dressed herself hastily and ate her
breakfast; then, as soon as she could, she
started for the theatre.</p>

<p>There was quite a group of girls at the
stage door when she reached there and, of
course, they had all come on the same
errand.</p>

<p>“The notice on the call board says that the
treasurer will take charge at once,” said
one of the girls just as Marion came up.
“He is Graham’s brother and I believe he
has money in the enterprise.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’ll be no performance to-night,
anyway,” said another girl turning
away, “but the new manager has called a
rehearsal for to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Marion waited to see for what time the
rehearsal was called and then started back
uptown to tell Dollie what had happened.</p>

<p>A block from the theatre a carriage was
driven closely to the curb and a handsome
young man, tall and aristocratic in appearance,
leaned out of the window and greeted
her eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Ray!” cried Marion, as she
recognized her old friend and champion.
“I am so delighted to see you again!”</p>

<p>In an instant Mr. Ray was out on the
pavement beside her.</p>

<p>“Do let me drive you wherever you are
going,” he said, quickly.</p>

<p>“To Dollie’s, then,” laughed Marion, as
she entered the carriage.</p>

<p>Her lovely face was radiant as Mr. Ray
smiled down into her eyes, for in a second
Marion’s beauty seemed enhanced a hundred
fold.</p>

<p>Her cheeks flushed and paled at the unexpected
pleasure and little dimples appeared
that were not often seen and which
made her face for the minute almost as
childishly sweet as her twin sister’s.</p>

<p>“And I am delighted to see you also,”
murmured Mr. Ray, softly. “Both my sister
and I have been striving to meet you,
but you have no idea how busy we are,
Marion.”</p>

<p>He uttered her name as though it was
sacred to him, and the fair girl’s eyelids
drooped shyly as she heard him.</p>

<p>“You see we have sold our house and are
storing the most of our things,” he continued,
rather sadly, “for there are only two
of us now, and we intend to travel. I am in
wretched health, and I know it is better.”</p>

<p>He spoke a little doubtfully, as if arguing
with himself, but Marion understood and
hastened to turn the subject.</p>

<p>“I am sure that you must be busy with all
that to do,” she added, quickly, “but have
you heard that my manager is dead, Mr.
Ray? I am to have a vacation perforce—I
do not know for how long until I see our
new manager to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I read of the horrible occurrence,” was
the answer. “I am glad all women are not
like that dreadful Carlotta.”</p>

<p>Once more he gazed down into Marion’s
eyes with his tender smile, and the fair girl’s
heart throbbed with a sweet emotion.</p>

<p>She knew only too well what he was longing
to say, and she knew also why it was
that the words could not be uttered.</p>

<p>Archie Ray had loved her almost from the
hour they met, and then, poor fellow, he supposed
he had a right to love her—but later,
before the sweet question had been asked, he
discovered that the woman whom he had
married when a boy at college, and who he
thought had been dead for two years, was
still alive, and, more, that she was now a
thoroughly dissolute character.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>The knowledge had shocked him beyond
expression, but he had borne it like a man
and Marion had helped him. Only a short
time after the discovery the wretched creature
died. She had drifted to Blackwell’s
Island as a “drunk and disorderly,” her face
disfigured by vitriol which had been thrown
upon her by another low woman.</p>

<p>It was Marion Marlowe’s lot to round out
the fearful tragedy, for at the very last moment,
when poor Mary Ray’s body was <i>en
route</i> for Potter’s Field, it was she who rescued
her remains and gave them back to her
husband and to a Christian burial.</p>

<p>Since that time Marion and Mr. Ray had
met but once. That was at Dollie’s wedding
at the little flat in Harlem.</p>

<p>And now he was thinking of going away,
yet she knew that he loved her more deeply
than ever—she could read it in his eyes and
in his voice when he spoke to her.</p>

<p>But the beautiful girl was not so sure of
her own sentiments as she was of his, for the
question of love had always been put aside
by her—there was too much else to be considered
in the fearful struggle for existence.
Until Dollie was safely settled she did not
dare to think of herself, but now with these
tender eyes looking almost into her soul,
Marion was forced to, in a measure, analyze
her feelings for him.</p>

<p>“You will come and see us, will you not?”
she asked earnestly, as she raised her lovely
eyes to his face. “Dear Dollie is so happy
in her little home. Do promise me that you
will come and see us.”</p>

<p>There was something in her voice that
thrilled his very soul and in an instant every
barrier seemed to melt from between them.</p>

<p>A sudden pallor appeared upon his handsome
face at her request, then a flush rose
swiftly to his very brow as he answered:</p>

<p>“I will come, Marion, on one condition,”
he murmured, eagerly. “Oh, Marion, darling!
Don’t you know that I love you?
May I not come to you as your lover,
dearest?”</p>

<p>He had taken her hands in his as he spoke
and his dark eyes were looking into hers
as though he would read her heart’s
every secret.</p>

<p>But after the first flush of excitement the
loyal girl’s lips became firm and she raised
her eyes to his face with a tender, anxious
expression.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Ray! I am so sorry! But it
cannot be! I am too young, too inexperienced!
I do not know my own heart! Do,
please, please forget that you have asked
me that question!”</p>

<p>Archie Ray’s face paled to the lips, but he
smiled at her bravely.</p>

<p>“As you will, Marion,” he said, almost
sadly. “Forgive me if I have pained you,
but, oh, my darling, do not decide too
quickly! Give me a month, a year, and I
will wait patiently.”</p>

<p>Marion bowed her head. She could not
answer. This avowal of love had almost
overwhelmed her.</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="XI. MARION IS LURED INTO A TRAP">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>MARION IS LURED INTO A TRAP.</small></h3>

<p>When Marion reached home she was delighted
to find Bert Jackson there. He had
come from Canada the day before and expected
to sail for Europe in two days, but his
first thought seemed to be for the welfare of
Dollie and Marion. He was a fine-looking lad
in his stylish clothes, and when Marion first
caught sight of him she hardly knew him.</p>

<p>“You don’t look much like the bare-footed
boy in blue jeans that you were last summer,
Bert,” she said, laughingly, as she finally
pulled her hands away from the grasp he had
given them.</p>

<p>“No, I’m a dude now,” said Bert, very
gayly. “All I lack is an eye-glass, a walking-stick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>and a lisp. Oh, I know what they look
like! There’s lots of ’em loafing around in my
class in society.” The girls both screamed at
Bert’s allusion to society, although the boy
had only made the remark jestingly.</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t you be in society?”
asked Marion, after a pause. “You have
plenty of money, and that seems to be nearly
all that is needed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you ought to have a pedigree like a
trotter to be real, dead swell,” said Bert,
quickly, “and I’m only an orphan brought up
on a poor farm!”</p>

<p>“This society business just makes me sick!
I’ve been in it a month, and I’m ready to
graduate any minute.”</p>

<p>“They are not all bad, thank Heaven!”
said Marion, soberly. “I suppose the percentage
of goodness is about the same in all
classes. But tell me, Bert, what are your
plans for the future? You know, Dollie and
I are your sisters, and we shall always be
interested.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Marion!” said Bert, jumping
up and facing her. “I don’t object to calling
Dollie any old thing you like, but you can’t
play the sister racket on me, for I’m fully
determined to marry you some day!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert! How ridiculous you are!” said
the fair girl, laughing.</p>

<p>“Promise me that you will not say ‘yes’ to
anybody for a year. Do promise, Marion.
It will make me perfectly happy.”</p>

<p>Marion looked at him sharply to see if he
was in earnest. Just at that minute Dollie
came to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Why, Bert, how foolish of you!” she exclaimed,
with great wisdom. “If sister cares
for you she does not need to promise, and if
she doesn’t, why, of course, you don’t want
her to promise.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” said the lad, growing
thoughtful. “They say love is like lightning—it
goes where ’tis sent—so, if that’s
the case, there’s no use in my trying to control
it.”</p>

<p>There was a ring at the bell, and Marion
was glad of the interruption. For the first
time in his life Bert was growing too serious.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dollie!” she cried, as she tore open
a note that had come to her by a messenger
boy, “Miss Lindsay is very ill, and wishes
me to come to her at seven o’clock, if I possibly
can. I must go, of course, but Mr. Ray
is coming to call. Still, perhaps, I can return
early; it’s not a very great distance.”</p>

<p>“Try to,” said Dollie, “for, of course, Adele
will be with him. Oh, I am so glad they are
coming! I have not seen them since my wedding.”</p>

<p>Bert went away soon, and the two girls
busied themselves in tidying up the flat, and
at about a quarter of seven Marion started
to visit Miss Lindsay. Little did she dream
when she said good-bye to Dollie that another
trap had been laid for her unsuspecting
feet and that she was going deliberately to
her own destruction.</p>

<p>She smiled happily at her sister as she
tripped down the steps, and her sweet face
was so radiant with joy and health that
nearly every one she passed turned at once
and looked after her.</p>

<p>“What an awful neighborhood,” she
thought, as she reached Miss Lindsay’s block
at last. It was farther from Dollie’s than
she had anticipated.</p>

<p>When she saw the number she was seeking
on the door of a dilapidated tenement-house,
she breathed a sigh of sympathy for little
Miss Lindsay.</p>

<p>“I did not dream she was so poor,” she
murmured, and then, lifting her skirts carefully,
she picked her way through a swarm
of dirty-faced children and boldly mounted
the rickety steps of the dingy tenement.</p>

<p>Up, up she went, and still no signs of
Miss Lindsay. She inquired on each landing,
but not half of the women whom she asked
understood her, for they were mostly ignorant
foreigners who did not know a word
of English.</p>

<p>At last, at the very top of the house, she
saw a half-open door, and almost as she
touched it she came face to face with Miss
Lindsay.</p>

<p>“Oh, signorita!” cried the girl, in a half-whisper,
as she saw her. Then, without another
word, she burst into violent weeping.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, dear,” said Marion, as she put
her arms around the girl. “I understand:
you are ill, and poor, and unhappy, but I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>help you gladly. I am so glad you sent for
me, dear.”</p>

<p>Instead of answering, the poor chorus girl
began weeping more bitterly than ever. Her
frail form was racked with sobs that were
heart-rending. The more earnestly Marion
endeavored to comfort her the more hysterical
she became, until at last the brave girl
was fairly bewildered.</p>

<p>“How can I help you, dear, if you do not
tell me your trouble?” she asked, in desperation,
at the same time laying her hand softly
on Miss Lindsay’s shoulder.</p>

<p>In a second the girl dropped on her knees
before her. As she lifted her streaming eyes
to Marion’s face she seemed suddenly to have
grown a dozen years older.</p>

<p>“Oh, signorita, forgive me!” she cried, in
agony. “Forgive me for wronging you. I
did not mean it! Oh, I am a guilty, vile
woman to do as I have done, but I love him.
Oh, I love him, and I could not help it!”</p>

<p>For just one second Marion Marlowe was
dazed, then, like a flash, it came to her comprehension
what the weeping girl meant.
She had once more been led into some wicked
trap. Either her life or her virtue was in immediate
danger.</p>

<p>“What is it? Quick! You must tell me!”
she cried, seizing the girl by both shoulders.
“I forgive you freely for your part in the
matter, only tell me what it is, that I may
protect myself. A moment more and it may
be too late. Hurry, I implore you!”</p>

<p>There was a heavy step on the stair and
Marion had heard it. The girl heard it also,
and it seemed to paralyze her senses.</p>

<p>“Too late! Too late!” she whispered, wildly.
Then, with a bound, she sprang to her
dilapidated bureau and opened it.</p>

<p>“Here, take this!” she whispered, thrusting
a revolver into Marion’s hand. “And, oh,
forgive me for letting them make a tool of
me, Miss Marlowe! I would save you now
if I could! Oh, what a guilty creature I
am!”</p>

<p>She sank down, cowering at her visitor’s
feet, just as Marion dropped the weapon
carefully into her pocket.</p>

<p>There was another footstep heard in the
hall and some one touched the door.</p>

<p>Marion turned and faced the emergency
calmly, but with flashing eyes, and at that
moment Miss Lindsay raised her head and
whispered, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Be careful! It is loaded! For God’s
sake don’t shoot him!”</p>

<p>Marion did not move her eyes from the
door, neither did she heed the last words.</p>

<p>“It would not be much use to me if it were
not loaded,” she said, very coolly. Then, as
a beautiful statue, she stood, silently, calmly,
and—waited!</p>

<h3 title="XII. MARION IS MADE A PRISONER">CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>MARION IS MADE A PRISONER.</small></h3>
</div>

<p>As the low door was thrown rudely and
violently open the brave girl instantly recognized
the intruder. It was Jack Green,
the property man from the theatre, inadequately
disguised with a wig and a false mustache.</p>

<p>Behind him came another man whom
Marion did not know. As soon as they
had entered they closed the door behind
them.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Green, you have laid your
plans well,” said Marion, as she fingered the
revolver in her pocket. “You have lured
me here on an errand of mercy. Now, what,
may I ask, is the next act on the programme?”</p>

<p>“So she told you, did she?” sneered the
man, with a glance at Miss Lindsay. “The
little cry baby turned traitor, did she, and
yet only last night she swore that she
loved me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do! I do, Jack!” sobbed the poor,
weak girl, hysterically, “but I could not do
it, Jack; it was too awfully wicked! I had
to tell her even though you killed me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll deal with you later,” said the
fellow, brutally. “A man’s wife is his property
and he can do what he likes with her.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that she is your wife?”
cried Marion, in horror: “you wretch! you
monster! To have a wife and abuse her!”</p>

<p>“Shut up your pretty mouth, if you
please,” said Jack Green, sullenly: “and if
you’ll come with us quietly, why well and
good; if you won’t, why then, we’ll——”</p>

<p>You’ll what? asked Marion, calmly, as
she clenched the pistol tighter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>There was a sudden movement of the
burly fellow, then a quick, cat-like spring
from his companion.</p>

<p>Marion felt a heavy hand upon her left
arm and shoulder.</p>

<p>In a second she wheeled around, her revolver
in her hand.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” she said, sternly. “Don’t
lay a hand on me, cowards! I’ll shoot you
like dogs if you dare touch me or this
woman!”</p>

<p>Both men fell back for the space of a
second, then together they sprang at her
and seized her arms.</p>

<p>Marion snapped the trigger of the pistol
in the leader’s face. There was no report;
the weapon was broken.</p>

<p>In less than a minute the beautiful, struggling
girl was bound and gagged. The last
that she remembered was hearing Miss Lindsay
cry for mercy.</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes again she was
in a closed carriage. There was a handkerchief
across her mouth and her wrists were
tied together loosely.</p>

<p>Opposite her in the carriage sat Jack
Green’s companion. His dark, burning eyes
gleamed at her from under a slouch hat and
never left her face for a moment.</p>

<p>The air in the carriage was almost stifling,
and without thinking of the consequences
Marion half rose from her seat and with her
manacled hands made a feeble effort to lower
the window.</p>

<p>“The window is locked and so are the
doors,” said a muffled voice. “You are a
prisoner, Miss Marlowe, so you may as well
submit gracefully.”</p>

<p>Marion glanced at the speaker as she sank
back upon her seat. The voice was almost
familiar. She tried to think where she had
heard it.</p>

<p>After that not a word was spoken until the
carriage stopped. They had been riding for
a long time and Marion was almost exhausted.</p>

<p>Some one opened the carriage door from
the outside and let in a shaft of light from
the side lamps.</p>

<p>The young girl caught one glimpse of a
hideous face, and then drew back with a gasp
of horror.</p>

<p>It was the Chinaman with the fearfully
scarred face who stood by the step. In the
glare of the lamp she had recognized him
instantly.</p>

<p>“Get out!”</p>

<p>The words were spoken in the same muffled
voice by the occupant of the carriage,
and as Marion rose to her feet her companion
deftly blindfolded her.</p>

<p>She could smell a sickening odor as the
hideous Chinaman took her in his arms. It
made her ill and faint almost in a second.</p>

<p>The poor girl realized that she was being
carried into some sort of a house and almost
instinctively she guessed that it was a laundry.
Passing through a room that smelled
strongly of suds, she could feel that she was
being carried down some steps and through
a long, narrow passage-way. At last a key
clicked in a lock and a door was opened and
then closed behind her. She had evidently
arrived at the end of her journey.</p>

<p>In an instant the bands were entirely removed,
and as she opened her eyes and
looked about she almost cried aloud in astonishment.</p>

<p>It was as if she had been suddenly transported
to another sphere—there was absolutely
nothing familiar in a single detail of
her surroundings.</p>

<p>She was in a large, low room, hung with
Oriental tapestries and covered with thick,
rich rugs. There were multi-colored lanterns
hanging from various points of the
ceiling, and low couches, small tables and
magnificently inlaid stools were scattered
profusely about the apartment.</p>

<p>The hideous Chinaman had disappeared
completely, but her companion in the carriage
was still seated at her side; he seemed
to be watching her amazement with a great
deal of satisfaction.</p>

<p>As Marion gazed about she soon became
sensible of a delicate, all-pervading odor—it
greeted her nostrils at every turn and was
slowly exerting its influences upon her
senses as a powerful soporific.</p>

<p>“Where am I? What is this place?” she
demanded of her companion. “How dare
you bring me here! Have you no regard for
the laws of your country?”</p>

<p>There was a soft, low chuckle from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>man at her side. Marion held her breath
for a second as she heard it. “Let me out of
this place at once!” she said, furiously, “I
demand that you set me at liberty, sir!
What have I done to you that you should
treat me so shamefully?”</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you?” hissed a low voice that
she now recognized fully. “Shall I tell you
what you have done, Signorita Ila de
Parloa?”</p>

<p>“What, you, Carlotta?” cried Marion,
aghast. “You, a woman, have stooped to
this hideous crime? Yes, tell me at once, if
you can, what I have done to deserve it!”</p>

<p>She was facing her companion with absolute
fearlessness now, and, as the woman
threw off her slouch hat together with a wig
and false beard, the two stood glaring
fiercely at each other in the strange apartment.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what you did, you little country
innocent!” cried Carlotta, furiously.
“You robbed me of my laurels as prima
donna of our company, then you robbed me
of the man whose very shadow I adored, and
yes, you goaded me on to such jealous rage
that I killed my lover! I killed Clayton
Graham because you came between us, Marion
Marlowe!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, never!” cried Marion, who was
aghast with horror. “You killed him in a
fit of ungovernable temper. It was not because
of me—I am innocent, Carlotta.”</p>

<p>“I do not choose to think so,” said the
woman, scornfully. “I vowed to have revenge
and I have won it—to my sorrow!”</p>

<p>The groan of agony that followed these
words almost melted Marion’s heart to pity.
The woman was vile, she was all that was
loathsome and bad, yet God alone knew the
depths of her suffering.</p>

<p>In another instant she was shaking with
sobs; yet her great dark eyes only burned
with the agony of hate: there was no tears
of relief for the wretched Carlotta.</p>

<p>“Why have you brought me here?” demanded
Marion again, as soon as she could
control herself sufficiently to ask the question.</p>

<p>The answer sent a thrill of horror through
every fiber of her body, it was so utterly diabolical,
so cold, cruel and fiendish.</p>

<p>Carlotta raised her head and fixed her
burning eyes upon Marion’s face.</p>

<p>“This is an opium den, the best and the
worst in the city,” she said, hoarsely. “Men
and women come here to live and die. It is
better, they think, than dying in prison. I
have come here to smoke the drug and
dream. I want to sleep and dream—to
dream and sleep. Perhaps I shall find rest
for the agony of my soul; perhaps I shall
only find torture to the very end; but in
either case I want you here to keep me company.”</p>

<h3 title="XIII. THE DIABOLICAL BARGAIN">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>THE DIABOLICAL BARGAIN.</small></h3>

<p>As Carlotta ceased speaking she tapped
a curiously shaped bell. In an instant a
Chinese servant entered noiselessly.</p>

<p>“I want to smoke, John,” said the woman,
with a wave of her hand. Marion’s eyes
followed the motion and saw she had
pointed toward an “opium layout” on one of
the small tables.</p>

<p>The grave girl watched what followed
with wide-staring eyes. She had not fully
realized yet that she was really a prisoner.</p>

<p>Carlotta, as one who was perfectly familiar
with the place, stepped behind a heavy
curtain. When she emerged again she had
completely discarded her disguise and was
dressed in a long, loose Oriental garment.</p>

<p>Without a word to Marion she passed
slowly across the room. There was another
heavy portiere before her—she disappeared
behind it.</p>

<p>In a moment the Chinaman followed, carrying
the little table. His movements were
so noiseless and cat-like that they were almost
uncanny.</p>

<p>Marion walked deliberately toward the
curtain and looked behind it, then darted
back with an exclamation of horror.</p>

<p>What she saw was another room adjoining
the one she was in, but this apartment
was fitted with curious berth-like beds, and
in three of these she saw women sleeping.</p>

<p>A glance was enough to show her the full
horror of the place, for upon one face was
stamped the most hideous expression that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>could be conceived—as if the dreamer was
being tormented by unspeakable visions.</p>

<p>Two Chinamen in their native garments,
but with queues curled tightly around their
heads, were sitting by the sleepers, preparing
the opium, and as they rolled the little
“pills” in their long yellow fingers, Marion
clasped her hands before her eyes—it was
too horrible to witness.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am lost, I am lost!” she whispered
to herself. “If ever I am forced to touch that
stuff I shall die of horror! Oh, this is
awful! awful!”</p>

<p>She sprang back into the large room
which she now concluded was a sort of parlor,
and just at that instant she became aware
that some one was watching her.</p>

<p>She turned to find the beady eyes of an
Oriental fixed steadily upon her. He was
better dressed than the others, and his fingers
were covered with jewels.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” cried Marion, desperately, “for
the love of Heaven, save me! Help me to
escape from this place and I will reward you
handsomely!”</p>

<p>Much to her delight the fellow understood
her, but he shook his head and crept softly
nearer, as he answered:</p>

<p>“Chi-Lung-Hing no savee, he keepee,
treat allee light. Chinamen muchee love
Amelican bleauty,” he murmured, glibly.</p>

<p>Marion shuddered as she caught the full
meaning of his words. His eyes were fixed
upon her with an expression of gloating that
filled her soul with horror.</p>

<p>“But I will not stay! He shall not keep
me!” she cried, in desperation. “I will set
the house on fire and perish in the flames
before you shall keep me prisoner.”</p>

<p>She spoke so firmly and her eyes gleamed
with such fury that the Celestial actually
looked frightened. He edged a little nearer.</p>

<p>“What, no love Chinaman money,
Missee? No workee—no slavee—Chi-Lung-Hing
mally Amelican bleauty—Dlive her
plenty pletty dresses—makee her happy!”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Marion, who was now
thoroughly alarmed. She bounded away
from him and began examining the premises.</p>

<p>There was nothing but the four walls and
they seemed almost impervious to sound.
She began to think that the magnificent
room was located in a cellar.</p>

<p>The Celestial watched her with glittering,
stealthy eyes as she peered behind each curtain
and then in a fit of desperation shook
the one door of the apartment.</p>

<p>“I am a prisoner!” she cried, at last. “Oh,
Dollie, little sister, will I ever come back
to you?”</p>

<p>She sank down on a divan to think a little,
then once more she rushed over to the curtain
to look for Carlotta.</p>

<p>As she peered behind the heavy drapery
she saw that something unusual was evidently
happening. The three Chinamen inside
were whispering excitedly to each other.
Carlotta was lying in one of the bunks, her
face strangely blue and distorted, and as
Marion stared at her from the entrance, she
felt the bejeweled Chinaman slip past her.
Something was wrong with Carlotta, she did
not know what—she moved forward a step
and her foot struck something lying on the
carpet.</p>

<p>Marion bent down and picked it up—it
was an ordinary key. In an instant she had
flown back across the room to the door and
had opened it softly.</p>

<p>The next moment she found herself in a
heavily draped hall-way. It was so thickly
strewn with rugs and mats that no sound
from the outer world could possibly penetrate
to it.</p>

<p>The young girl darted ahead, peering behind
the heavy curtains in hopes of finding
an exit, but after a few terrible moments,
during each of which she expected that her
Chinese jailer would notice her flight and follow
her, she suddenly heard muffled voices
behind one of the draperies and tried to
calm herself enough to listen.</p>

<p>“You promised the woman five hundred
dollars,” said Jack Green’s voice on the
other side of the thick curtain, “and you
promised me three hundred if I would help
her. Now the girl is here—we have kept
our part of the bargain. If she escapes you
now, it is not our fault, is it?”</p>

<p>“She will not escape,” answered a soft,
Oriental voice, in the clearest English.
“Your American girls like my Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>harem. She will stay from preference after
she becomes acquainted.”</p>

<p>“Or after you have made her your wife,
you mean,” said Jack Green, with a laugh.
“Well, I’m telling you right now—this girl
is a beauty.”</p>

<p>“I must see her before I pay,” said the
voice again. “Wait here; I will go in; if I
like her, you shall have your money.”</p>

<p>“I agree to that,” was Jack Green’s quick
answer, “but don’t expect a tame bird, Chi-Lung,
for Marion Marlowe is a wild one!”</p>

<p>“I will find a way to tame her,” said the
oily voice. There was silence after that, and
Marion clenched her hands in fury.</p>

<p>“Listen!”</p>

<p>Jack Green spoke suddenly and in evident
alarm.</p>

<p>There was a commotion of some kind
above her head. Marion listened intently as
she crouched in the semi-darkness.</p>

<p>“Some trouble in the laundry,” said the
musical voice. “A great scheme, that laundry
in the front of this building.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless that noise sounds serious,”
said Green, again.</p>

<p>There was the sound of chairs moving as
if they had both risen.</p>

<p>Marion listened again. The noise above
her head was growing louder. Not only
were there sounds of trampling feet, but a
great confusion of voices, all talking together.</p>

<p>Suddenly Marion heard a crash and a fearful
shriek, then a score of slip-shod feet
seemed scampering to shelter.</p>

<p>For an instant the young girl stood almost
petrified with fear; then she turned and
fled through the narrow hall-way, hardly
knowing or caring in which direction.</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3 title="XIV. THE END OF THE TRAGEDY">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>THE END OF THE TRAGEDY.</small></h3>

<p>A sharp turn in the hallway caused Marion
to shriek with terror. Two hideous Chinamen
had sprung at her, and as they caught
her in their arms, one of the beady-eyed
wretches forced a saturated cloth over her
nostrils.</p>

<p>Marion felt her breath coming in quick,
short gasps. She struggled feebly, but her
brain seemed reeling.</p>

<p>In a flash she was carried along the hall,
down a flight of steep steps, and then, after
the click of a key in a lock, she was taken
into a room that was as dark as a dungeon.
A confused jargon of voices came faintly to
her ears and she could feel that the place
was fairly swarming with the yellow devils.</p>

<p>The entire roomful of beings seemed to
fall back as she was carried along, and at
last she was placed on a sort of divan in the
very darkest and most heavily-draped corner
of what seemed to her to be a subterranean
apartment. The cloth on her nostrils was
pungent with narcotics, but she managed by
a great effort of the will to somewhat resist
its influence.</p>

<p>Suddenly the light of a swinging lamp
flashed from somewhere above her head, and
one glance about her made Marion’s heart
grow sick with horror.</p>

<p>A score or more of those gaunt-cheeked
fellows were surrounding her, and as the first
ray of the lamp fell upon her face, they all
pressed forward and peered at her sharply.</p>

<p>In the onslaught which his companions
made on him the fellow who was holding the
cloth to Marion’s face dropped it from his
fingers, and with the first clear breath Marion
dashed to her feet and confronted them.</p>

<p>“Stand back! Don’t you dare to touch
me!” she cried, springing up on the divan,
which stood directly under the hanging lamp.</p>

<p>In a second a dozen pairs of long, skinny
hands were reached out for her, and as Marion
felt them clutching her arms and body,
she gave a shriek that awoke the echoes.</p>

<p>The next instant she reached up quickly
and, with one blow of her white hand, shivered
the glass of the lamp; then, with the
flame blowing wildly in the draughts of the
room, she broke it from its fastenings and
began swinging it like a censer.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” she shouted again. “Don’t
you dare to come nearer! I will burn your
house down about your heads if you lay a
finger upon me!”</p>

<p>As she spoke she waved the lamp closer to
the draperies, and the Chinamen fell back
and began chattering excitedly.</p>

<p>For just a second she held them at bay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>while the glare from the lamp illumined her
glorious features. Then, from directly over
her head, there came a sharp, shrill whistle.
As the Chinamen heard it they seemed to lose
their wits entirely, and in an instant their
beautiful prisoner was forgotten.</p>

<p>With shrieks and yells of rage they scrambled
over each other, and then slunk like rats
into the darkest corners.</p>

<p>Once more the young girl’s voice rang out
like a bugle blast, and then, to her unbounded
delight, it was answered from somewhere.</p>

<p>Cry after cry issued rapidly from her lips.
They were coming to save her. She could
hear footsteps and voices.</p>

<p>As the door was burst in a gust of wind
extinguished her lamp, and Marion sank
down upon the divan in utter helplessness.</p>

<p>“Miss Marlowe! Is it possible! Thank
Heaven, I am in time!”</p>

<p>It was Howard Everett who spoke, and
with a cry of joy Marion answered him.</p>

<p>A score of burly policemen seemed to fill
the place, and Everett drew her closely to his
side as they darted about after the Celestials.</p>

<p>“They are raiding the place,” he whispered
in her ear. “How fortunate that the
attempt was so opportune! For once in my
life my good angel must have guided me!
Come, let us get out of this,” he added, leading
Marion to the door and half lifting her
up the steps to the narrow hallway.</p>

<p>“But Carlotta! Have they found her?”
asked Marion, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“The woman is dead! I did not mean she
should escape me,” was her companion’s answer.
“It seems she had heart disease, and
the opium killed her. Well, at last my friend
Graham’s death has been avenged, but your
presence here, Miss Marlowe! I cannot
understand it!”</p>

<p>Marion held out her hand to him as she
was being hurried along.</p>

<p>“You followed her here because you think
she was his murderer?” she whispered, softly.</p>

<p>“I had no doubt of it,” was Everett’s reply.
“Detectives have been watching the woman
ever since. They tracked her here, and then
I asked the captain to raid the place.”</p>

<p>They were passing through the pseudo
laundry now, but there was not a Chinaman
in sight. The room was absolutely deserted.</p>

<p>“And you heard my voice?” asked the
young girl, as Mr. Everett supported her tenderly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but did not recognize it, of course,”
said Mr. Everett quickly. “I thought it was
the voice of one of their white slaves. But do
hurry, Miss Marlowe, and tell me how you
came here.”</p>

<p>With a tremendous stamping of feet the
policemen came into the laundry.</p>

<p>“Nine chinks, one white man and four
women, one dead,” said the captain, in reply
to a question from Everett.</p>

<p>The critic whispered a few words in his
ear relating to Marion, and, with a sharp
glance at her face, the captain nodded.</p>

<p>“We’ve taken them all out through a side
door to this establishment that we found, and
three of my men have taken them away in
the patrol wagon. Come, boys, let’s get out
of this dope hole as soon as possible! Whew!
The aroma is something awful! I’ll be asleep
in another minute!”</p>

<p>“I thought I should faint when I first encountered
it,” said Marion to Everett. “Oh,
how thankful I am to you, Mr. Everett!”</p>

<p>There was a carriage at the curb, and the
critic helped her into it.</p>

<p>“What a narrow escape I have had!” cried
the girl, as Everett got in beside her. “An
hour longer in that place and I should have
been dead—like Carlotta!”</p>

<p>Then she hastened to tell her friend the
whole story of her adventure.</p>

<p>The papers were full of it the next day,
and, thanks to Howard Everett, every detail
was given accurately.</p>

<p>Beautiful Marion’s escape from the lair of
the Celestials formed the talk of the town for
days. She was perhaps the first white girl
to leave that place untainted.</p>

<p>Both she and Mr. Everett appeared before
the authorities the next day, and it was not
long before Chi-Lung-Hing, his subjects,
and Jack Green were all safely in prison.</p>

<p>The three white girls were restored to their
homes and parents, and the numerous expensive
opium “layouts” were confiscated and
destroyed by the police.</p>

<p>The wicked Carlotta left money enough to
afford her a decent burial, but there was not
a mourner at her dreary funeral.</p>

<p>The Temple Opera Company was obliged
to disband; but now that Miss Lindsay was
freed from her brutal husband, she was able
to take a position in another organization and
live very comfortably on her modest salary.</p>

<p>At Miss Allyn’s urgent request, Marion
went to live with her until she could secure
another position, and besides Dr. Brookes
and Mr. Ray, Howard Everett, the critic,
was soon a frequent caller at the little flat.</p>

<p>But Marion was as loyal to her associates
as ever, and she was so pure, so true and so
noble in character that no thought of jealousy
ever annoyed for a long time any of her
friends who loved her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—This department will be made a special feature of this publication. It will be conducted by Miss Shirley,
whose remarkable ability to answer all questions, no matter how delicate the import, will be much appreciated, we feel
sure, by all our readers, who need not hesitate to write her on any subject. Miss Shirley will have their interests at
heart and never refuse her assistance or sympathy.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Will you please advise me in the following
matter? I am engaged to a young man who is
only making twenty dollars a week, and who is
obliged to support his old father and mother. If
I marry him I must live with the old folks, and
do all the work. Do you think by doing this I
could ever be happy?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mamie.</span>”</p></div>


<p>We think the chances are that you would be
very miserable indeed. You had better wait until
the young man is able to employ some one to
take care of his parents, and then you can have
your own little nest together. It is not well, as a
rule, for a young married couple to begin life in
the same house with their relatives.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have been reading the ‘Marion Marlowe’
stories with great interest, but I am inclined to
think that Marion is something of a coquette, and
that she does not seem to know her own mind
where her lovers are concerned. The stories are
very interesting and exciting, and I enjoy them
immensely, but I felt sorry for ‘Archie Ray’ and
‘Dr. Brookes.’ I feel like scolding Marion because
she does not love them. I wish I had her
chance to marry either one of them. If they are
really true characters I wish you would send
me their addresses.</p>

<p class="right">“M. B.”</p></div>

<p>We are glad to hear that you are reading the
“My Queen” series, but we are afraid you have
not studied Marion’s character very thoroughly.
She has been absolutely honest with the two
young men you mention, and no one would
resent the term of “coquette” more quickly than
they would. Unfortunately, we do not know their
addresses at present, so we cannot favor you, but
no doubt, both gentlemen would feel honored at
your candid appreciation.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have been married two years, and have a
baby six months old. My husband says I give all
my time to the baby and none to him. The baby
is delicate, and no one can soothe him except his
mother. If I must neglect either one, which
should be neglected?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Florence McK.</span>”</p></div>

<p>This is the same old story that we have heard
many times. Many married men use it as an excuse
for spending their time elsewhere, and God
pity the wives of such inhuman monsters! You
have brought an innocent child into this world of
sin and woe. It is your duty to devote yourself to
it just so long as it needs or claims your devotion.
The claims of wife are nothing when compared
with the duty of motherhood. The man or woman
who would neglect his or her own child for
even one hour is guilty of the greatest sin
that can be committed. You cannot expect
your child to grow up loving or respecting
you unless you have proven yourself worthy of
these sentiments. Try and make your husband
understand your position and his in this important
matter.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have been brought up to think that it was a
sin to drink liquor, and now I am deeply in love
with a young man who often drinks a glass of
wine; who, to the best of my knowledge, has
never been tipsy. Would I be doing right to
marry this man? I do not know how I can give
him up, and yet I hate to go against my principle.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Edna.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Your anxiety is very natural, but we hardly
think you would be doing wrong to marry a man
who takes a glass of wine occasionally. History
is filled with the names of great men who were
not total abstainers. If liquor disagrees with a
man, or he is prone to yield to its insidious fascination,
that is another matter, but the mere
fact of a man taking an occasional drink is not a
sign that he is destined to fill a drunkard’s
grave. Total abstinence is commendable, and in
the case of men weak in will power it is almost a
necessity, but many a man who is a moderate
drinker will prove a better husband than the
total abstainer, whose other virtues are not as
fully developed as his abstinence.</p>

<p>Study the character of the man whom you
think perhaps to marry. If he is honorable,
brave and true, you can safely trust your life’s
happiness in his hands, despite his occasional
glass of wine.</p>

<p>“I am so sick at heart that I can hardly write
this letter, but I must know your opinion, my
dear Miss Shirley. I have been deeply in love
for over a year, and now I am forced to believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>that the object of my affections has forsaken me
for another. Oh, what can I do to win him back!
I shall certainly die if I have to live another
week without him!</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Imogen S.</span>”</p></div>

<p>There is anguish in every word of this letter,
and we are very sorry indeed for you, Imogen.
There is no grief so poignant as that which a
young girl feels when she awakes to the fact
which you seem to have discovered. But bear in
mind, my dear, that there are scores of lovely
and lovable men on earth, and perhaps your
cloud will yet have a silver lining. Some day
you will meet a man whose love will be all your
own, and you will be able to see that this first
disappointment was all for the best. We would
not advise you to try and get him back. If he
does not come back of himself his love is not
worth having.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Will you please tell me if you think fifteen is
too young to love? I am just that age, and I have
just met a young man who is very attractive, and
I know he is in love with me and wants me to
marry him. People tell me that at my age I don’t
know my own mind. I should hate to marry him
thinking that I love him and then find myself
mistaken.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lotta.</span>”</p></div>

<p>A letter like this is a positive treat! A girl of
fifteen who can reason so wisely will not be apt
to make many errors. A great deal of the misery
in the world has been created through thoughtless
and hasty marriages. Women marry men at
eighteen whom they despise at twenty-five, or
choose husbands at twenty-five whom they have
ceased to love or respect at thirty. Human nature
is ever changeable, and it is one of the most
difficult tasks in the world to discover two intellects
that will be perfect mates for life. One may
go ahead or lag behind, and because of this the
result of marriages is uncertain. We would certainly
advise you to wait until you are older.
No girl of fifteen is sufficiently well developed
mentally or physically to marry, and, furthermore,
your education cannot be completed at
your age.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have been married a year, and, oh, how I
regret it! Just think, Miss Shirley, I was an only
daughter. I earned ten dollars a week as cloak
model down town, and having no board to pay,
could use it all in pin money. Now ten dollars a
week has to do for a whole family, my husband,
myself and a six weeks’ old baby. I would give
the world if I had never been married, and I
write this letter as a warning to others. I do hope
you will print it in your correspondence columns.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We receive so many letters like this one that if
we printed them all we are afraid we should discourage
matrimony. You should have “looked
before you leaped,” but that is a thing that young
people in love rarely do. It seems strange that
love, or whatever the sentiment is that draws
some young people together, should so blind
their eyes to the future. We are very sorry that
you have made such a blunder, but now that you
have done it you should make the best of it. For
the sake of your child you must “put your shoulder
to the wheel” and try to conquer every obstacle
that threatens your domestic happiness.
Above all, try not to take too many into your
confidence in this wise; people will only laugh at
you for marrying in haste. It is better to hide
your grief and bear the penalty of your own
error with silent dignity.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have read your Correspondence Department
for several weeks with great interest, and wish to
add one more to the list of questions. What I
want to know is this: Is a woman of thirty too
old to marry a man of twenty-one, and what will
be the natural outcome of such a union?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Gertrude B.</span>”</p></div>

<p>As a rule, we should answer “yes” to the
above question, but there are exceptional cases
which demand a different answer. Some men of
twenty-one are very mature both mentally and
physically, and many women of thirty are as
sprightly as kittens. Mentality should always
decide this question. If a woman of thirty has
every taste in common with a man much younger
and feels confident that she possesses sufficient
spirit and magnetism to charm him through the
years that are before them, she is running very
little risk in marrying him. It is true that most
women age faster than most men, but the exception
is not so rare as it used to be, however.
Physical exercise and a more intelligent mode of
living are keeping our women young nowadays,
while the men are inclined to age a little prematurely.</p>

<p>“I am very much in love with a man of fifty
who is a widower with four children, the oldest
being only fifteen. Would you advise me to
marry him? He has no money of his own—is
working on a small salary.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Abbie S.</span>”</p></div>

<p>No, we do not advise you to marry him. The
position of step-mother to four children is not an
enviable one. No doubt, he wants you to be a
mother to his children, a wife to him, cook,
housekeeper, needle-woman and perhaps laundress.
We advise you to look farther before you
marry.</p>

<p>“I have read every number of ‘Marion Marlowe,’
and I can hardly wait for the weeks to
come around. I know a young man who is exactly
like ‘Bert Jackson,’ and I mean to catch him for
a husband, if possible. Do you blame me?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Nora.</span>”</p></div>

<p>I do not indeed, and I wish you success! Young
men like “Bert Jackson” are very rare. We advise
you to do all that you can, modestly and
properly, of course, to make Bert’s counterpart
fall in love with you. We are sure it will be a
happy marriage.</p>

<p>“I am about to be married, my dear Miss Shirley,
and I am sure it will surprise you to learn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>that I am very unhappy. All my life I have heard
and read of the ‘perfect bliss’ which a young girl
feels on the eve of her marriage, yet I am to be
married in a week, and I spend half of my time in
crying. I think that I love my future husband
very dearly, yet I can’t bear to give up my girlhood
and be a married woman, and then I am
beset by the responsibilities and uncertainties of
the future. Am I different from other girls, or is
this a natural feeling? I cannot talk to my mother
on this subject. She is a very peculiar woman and
only laughs at my anxieties.</p>

<p class="right">“C. F. B.”</p></div>

<p>Your condition of mind seems to us to be very
natural. The girl who can stand upon the
threshold of matrimony and feel differently must
be sadly lacking in the elements of common sense
and caution. But there is no necessity for leaving
your “girlhood behind.” Take it right along with
you into your married life, only add to it day by
day the grace and wisdom of a woman. I have
seen many married women who played with
dolls in their leisure hours, and I think their husbands
really enjoyed witnessing their innocent
pleasure. Women, or most of them, “settle down”
too thoroughly as soon as they are married. They
forget that it was their “girlishness” that first
charmed their lovers, and that this same “girlishness”
can be made to charm and hold a husband.
Never grow old in your husband’s eyes if
you can help it. As for the responsibilities and
uncertainties, they will not all come in a minute.
When they do come, you will be surprised to find
how easily you can manage them.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have been told over and over that all marriages
are failures, and as I look about me I am
tempted to believe it, yet if this is true, what is
the use of living? Must we go on slaving and
toiling without a ray of happiness in this life. If
marriage is a failure, then love is a failure. Is
there anything left worth living or striving for?</p>

<p class="right">“C. V. S.”</p></div>

<p>This letter is the result of some old busy-body’s
croaking. There are plenty of happy marriages
where love reigns supreme, and there will be
plenty more if truth is to be relied upon. The
people who say that marriage is a failure are
usually the ones who have made it a failure by
their own foolishness or wickedness. The ideal
married life is heaven on earth, and it is possible
to all who will strive to attain it. Choose wisely,
carefully and with moderation, then remember
that the germ of love must be constantly nourished,
and that the greatest care is needed to
make it bloom fragrantly. Those who expect
much are apt to give little. The perfect harmony
of the family depends upon mutual effort and a
constant endeavor to please one another.</p>

<p>This world would be a sad place indeed were it
not for love. The power of affinity holds the universe
together.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Will you please advise me in the following
matter: I have received an invitation to dine
with a man I have never met. He is a friend of
one of my girl friends, and I think she is in love
with him. She showed him my picture and now
he has written me this letter of invitation. I believe
he is rich, and I would like to meet him.
Would it be honorable to my friend to accept his
invitation?</p>

<p class="right">“A. F.”</p></div>

<p>First of all, we do not think it would be “honorable”
to yourself to dine with a man whom you
have never seen or to whom you have never been
introduced, and we cannot understand your considering
his invitation for a minute. The proper
thing for you to do is to pay no attention to the
letter. It was decidedly rude and uncomplimentary
to you to write it in the first place.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“The social season is just beginning in our
town, and there is a party, or ball, or something
of the sort almost every evening. I enjoy going
out more than anything else, but my parents object
to my doing so, and scold me continually. I
am sixteen years old, and it does seem to me that
I ought to be allowed to have some fun. Don’t
you think they are awfully mean not to allow me
pleasure of this sort?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Annie S.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Your parents are a great deal wiser than you
are, Annie, and we advise you not to go contrary
to their wishes. You are much too young to be
thinking of social pastimes. Stay at home for a
year or two more at least, and spend your time
with your books improving your mind and fitting
yourself to be a useful, helpful woman. When
you do begin to go out again make your pleasures
incidental to your life, and do not allow them to
absorb your whole time and thought.</p>

<p>“I have read every number of ‘My Queen’ and
have enjoyed them immensely. I think Marion
the sweetest girl that ever lived, and I am sure
that her creator, Miss Shirley, is awfully wise.
Will she be kind enough to spare time to give me
a little advice? I am nineteen years old and have
been in society for two years, but, somehow, I
don’t get along in company a bit. Other girls
laugh and talk, but I can never find anything to
say, and the men all vote me a bore, I am sure.
Can you tell me of some magic method by which
I can attain the social graces.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Jean R. R.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Thank you for your kind words in regard to “My
Queen” and the author’s wisdom. Experience
is the only teacher, Jean, and a hard one at that.
Do not be disheartened if you do not attract the
men who like the chattering, giggling girls—probably
you will attract the quietest and most
substantial, and make firmer friends of them than
the other girls could possibly make of the other
men. In a general way, you can probably overcome
your diffidence and backwardness in conversation
by endeavoring to discover in what subject
a man is interested and then talking of that. If
he finds that you are interested yourself in his fads
he will take interest enough in you to interest
himself in yours, and then the wheels of conversation
will run smoothly enough.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“One of the best fellows in the world has asked
me to become his wife. I esteem him highly—I
might almost say that I love him if I had not decided
long ago to leave the word ‘love’ out of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>dictionary. I feel that I would be happy indeed
if I were his wife, but there is a chapter in my
life that I dread to tell him, and still I think too
much of him to marry him without being perfectly
candid. Won’t you tell me what to do? I
am heart-broken over the situation.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Marie W. S.</span>”</p></div>

<p>It is much better to be frank before marriage
than to make two people unhappy after. If this
young man really loves you he will forgive much,
endure much, condone much, and his affection
will still survive in spite of all. If his regard
stands the test you will have a husband and lover
of whom you may be proud. If it does not you
may feel assured that he would have probably
made your married life miserable, and that you
have saved both him and yourself considerable
unhappiness. The man that will listen to your
revelation and continue to love you, has in that
one act proven his value. The man who does not,
likewise proves that his affection is a matter of
circumstance, and not the unfailing, all-enduring
type that is really of worth. There is an old
proverb, “Tell the truth and fear naught,” that
exactly fits your case.</p>

<p>“I am in love with one of the most charming
girls in the United States, but I am not quite sure
that she loves me. I have read lots of your good
advice to young women, so I hope you will be
willing to give me some. I want this girl for my
wife, but, frankly, I am afraid to ask her. I have
more of her society than any one else as it is, and
if she doesn’t accept me I am afraid I’ll lose it
all. Now, won’t you please advise me what to
do.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Edward H.</span>”</p></div>

<p>You seem to be a very diffident young man,
Edward. If you really love this girl, why don’t
you tell her so, and see what she says? “Faint
heart never won fair lady.” If she doesn’t love
you she will only say “no,” and then you can
look for another who will perhaps appreciate
your timid nature.</p>

<p>“I enjoy going about with the boys more than
I do anything else, and as I am a great favorite
with them I get lots of invitations. I live with
an aunt who makes my life miserable scolding
about my keeping late hours. I think she is really
jealous because I get attention and she doesn’t,
but I would like to know some way to avoid the
continual quarrels I have with her on the subject.
I am nearly eighteen years old, and I think
I ought to be allowed to have my own way, don’t
you?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mildred D.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Your aunt may not take the wisest way to
show you that you are acting foolishly, but her
intentions are certainly good. A girl of your
years should not spend her time “going about
with the boys.” You would be doing much
better if you would spend your leisure hours fitting
yourself to become the wife of some good
man who may some day desire your entire society.
The attentions of “the boys” may seem
very enjoyable now, but a few years later you
will no doubt look upon the time spent in this
way with regret. Do not be too anxious to have
your own way, but remember that other people’s
views may be much more sensible than your
own.</p>

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
